message: Animal control officer dumps cat in park instead of taking her to the shelter!

A friendly cat who was surrendered to a Dekalb County, Georgia veterinary clinic was supposed to be taken to the shelter - but instead, an animal control officer dumped her at a park.

My Fox Atlanta reported on Thursday that a calico cat named Frances was surrendered by her owner to St. Francis Veterinary Specialists clinic in Decatur, Georgia. Veterinary staff called DeKalb County Animal Control to pick up the cat and Southern Animal Rescue was contacted regarding a very friendly cat who was on her way to the shelter.

But Frances never made it to the shelter - instead, the animal control worker stated that the cat was believed to be a "stray," and the friendly, loving cat was taken to Shoal Creek Park I.

The animal control worker "thought that the cat was part of a trap and release program" for feral cats, but county officials stated that the cat was only supposed to be taken to the shelter.

Animal advocates worry that this might not be an isolated incident. Rescuer Kristin McKnight, whose organization had found a foster home for Frances before she was dumped, stated:

The information I got, was the cat was released to the wild. My concern is this hasn't been the first cat that's been dumped and was not taken to the shelter."

According to the organization that runs the DeKalb County shelter, an incident like this has not occurred before. The county has stated that animal control workers will have more training going forward and that the issue with the animal control worker who dumped the cat has been resolved. It is unclear at this time how the county addressed this issue.

Volunteers, including McKnight, are searching for Frances at the park and hope to find her soon. Updates to this story will be posted as they occur.
