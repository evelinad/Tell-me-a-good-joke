description: KIDS AND ANIMAL CRUELTY

Many research studies have reported that childhood cruelty to animals may be the first serious warning sign of later problems. Such behavior appears to be linked to conduct disorders, delinquency and criminal behavior.

Anywhere from one-fourth to two-thirds of violent adult offenders report a history of animal abuse during their childhood or adolescence, a rate substantially higher than groups of normal adults. Animal abuse, either by adults or by children, occurs at an alarming rate in homes where children are physically or sexually abused. Animal cruelty by children is more frequent in families where there is spousal abuse or repeated physical punishment of older children and adolescents.

There are many reasons why children abuse animals. For some, it simply is a matter of control. They obtain some level of emotional gratification out of exhibiting the ultimate control - pain and death - over another. Other children simply act out what has been done to them or their parent. In families where violence is common, children learn that hurting an animal is as acceptable as hurting another human being.

Children hurt animals as a way to channel the aggression that they feel but cannot act out in appropriate ways. All children occasionally have intense feelings of anger and rage. Most youngsters learn acceptable ways to manage those feelings. Some children hurt animals because they either don't know how to deal with those feelings, or don't care if they hurt another person or animal.

Hurting animals may be the first clinical sign of a child without a conscience. They do what they feel, and it doesn't matter what effect their behavior has on others, whether that be another person or an animal.

It's important to distinguish between intentional cruelties by children versus behavior by young children that reflect their developmental immaturity. Many preschool youngsters may pull the tail of their cat, sit on their puppy or step on a bug. These behaviors are not clinically significant, but rather reflective of the child's cognitive development. These types of situations require education and correction, not professional assistance.

I usually discourage my friends from seeking professional help for dealing with routine childhood problems. Most parents do just fine relying on their own skills, perhaps with some suggestions from friends and family.

However, if your child has routinely engaged in cruelty to animals, seek professional assistance. This is one of those early warning signs that require an immediate and serious response from parents and professionals.

Teaching kids to have compassion and empathy for their furry, feathered, and finned friends is vital for preventing cruelty to animals as well as in raising them to respect and treat those who are different from them with kindness.
