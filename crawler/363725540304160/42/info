message: South Florida dog brutally burned with hot oil has died!

A devastated family in Pembroke Pines mourns the loss of their one-year-old pit bull who was severely burned over the weekend while the family attended church, reports wsvn.com. Blu died on Thursday night.

Blu had been tied up in his back yard on Saturday, when someone is believed to have doused him with a scalding hot substance. He had been heavily sedated suffering from third degree burns so serious the dog's eyes had been swollen shut.

Blu's owner said someone specifically targeted their dog and waited for the family to leave their home. The owner added that the dog was okay when he and his aunt left to go to church. The next morning Craig and Emma White found their dog huddled in the dirt, obviously in pain and desperately seeking relief:

"He is a part of our family. How can you do this? He has burns almost [throughout] the entire body," Emma cried.

Veterinarian stated the dog must have rolled in the dirt and mud to extinguish the agonizing flames or liquid poured all over him.

If you have any information on who may have burned Blu, call Broward County Crime Stoppers at 954-493-TIPS.

A petition asking authorities to investigate this brutal animal cruelty can be found here.

The family is calling for answers and wants an investigation into this terrible animal cruelty crime. Can you blame them?
