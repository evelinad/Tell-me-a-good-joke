They are no better than Animals! Only a Monster would be capable of such acts! As a parent of Furry kids myself, my kids are my Life! They are STRICTLY INDOORS! They are only out in the garden "Sunbathing" when I am home.... As for the Parents of this poor dog, how is it so that you only discover this Terrible Act against your Furry child the next day????? Hey I am not judging here but it\'s not ROCKET SCIENCE!! n you tied your furry child up???!!!! WTF???????', u'id': u'973447619331946_973795275963847', u'user_likes': False}
