description: What is gelatin made of?

If you look at the ingredients on a package of gummy bears, you'll see expected things like corn syrup and sugar. But you'll also see something called gelatin. Seems innocent enough, but its source might surprise you. 

Gelatin. It's everywhere. Derived from the skin, connective tissue, and bones of animals, such as cattle bone, cattle hides and pigskins, gelatin is most definitely NOT vegetarian, contrary to what many will claim. Gelatin is made from by-products of the meat and leather industry, in which cruelty is innate.

Non-vegetarian marshmallows (the "average" marshmallow sold at supermarkets), desserts like “Jell-O,” frosted cereals, some low-fat yogurt, desserts, trifles, aspic, and many confectionaries such as gummy bears and jelly babies contain gelatin. It may also be used as a stabilizer, thickener, or texturizer in foods such as jams, yogurt, cream cheese, and margarine. Gelatin can also be used for the clarification of juices, such as apple juice, and of vinegar.

Gelatin is a yellowish, odorless, and nearly tasteless substance that is made by prolonged boiling of skin, cartilage, and bones from animals. It's made primarily from the stuff meat industries have left over — we're talking about pork skins, horns, and cattle bones. Yummy.

I guess if you're into the philosophy of using the whole animal, you'll be psyched about this. Plus gelatin contains 18 amino acids, so it does offer some nutritional benefits. But if you're vegan, you'll definitely want to skip the chewy candies and your great-aunt's Jell-O mold — it's made with gelatin, too. This animal-derived ingredient can also be found in some vitamins and medications, marshmallows (Peeps included), cheeses, yogurts, soups, salad dressings, jams and jellies, fruit snacks, and canned hams. If this tidbit of info grosses you out, you'll want to pay closer attention to these products' food labels.
