I want to see stories about exposing people who abuse animals and the victories of them going into jail or getting help from people on this page.\n\nThis page went from animal abuse and cruelty exposed to nothing but going vegan. A lot of the people on this page are not going to go vegan but want to help expose cruelty, and trying to push every person on this page to go vegan is just not going to happen. Meat is a part of a normal diet but exposing them to certain foods that they're eating that promotes animal cruelty is what this page is for. Not a hundred percent vegan promotion.", u'id': u'973827742627267_973882555955119', u'user_likes': False}
