description: Rabbit Farming: The Cruel Industry Exposed

Over the years, rabbits have been reared and killed for the purpose of consumption. In recent years, the number of rabbits being killed has sharply increased due to the growing demand, not only in food, but also as a source of fur. It is now one of the fastest growing sectors in the fur trade and yet the world is largely unaware of it. 

According to the reports, about 50 million animals are killed throughout the world solely for their fur. However, what is alarming is that rabbits are not counted amongst these numbers and although the precise numbers are yet to be determined, it is safe to say that the rabbits are being killed in millions.

Their only objective is to breed rabbits in large numbers for commercial purposes. The conditions in which the rabbits are reared are horrendous and can be described, at the least, as inhumane. Thus, they have come under the scrutiny of both governments and animal rights activists. Several Bans have been imposed by governments to ensure that the rabbits, if reared at all for such purposes, are bred in healthy and hygienic environment, and are stunned before they are killed. 

The rabbit factory farms around the world have similar conditions. They are dirty and unhygienic. These gentle creatures are made to live in tiny cages that are always overcrowded. They have the least possible space to move around and at times, cannot even stretch their limbs. The cages are infested with diseases, and the rabbits are easily infected. They are not even provided with the basic medical treatment and are forced to suffer through their illnesses.This is the common practice, not only during poor health, but year-round. There are no vets to give them the necessary shots, and the rabbit farmers are unconcerned about the overall health of the creatures.   

It is not only the living conditions of the rabbits that are alarming. The breeding process in rabbit factories is far from natural as the female rabbits are caged separately and then impregnated artificially. The female rabbits are kept in a separate breeding shed in tiny cages that are barely big enough to accommodate them, let alone carry the unborn babies to term. The rabbits are denied their natural mating process and are forced to procreate artificially. The young rabbits that are born are removed from the mother within 5 to 12 weeks and are relocated to the slaughterhouse.
