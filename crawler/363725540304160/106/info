description: Allegations of abuse, killings, and dog fighting in the NYC Animal Shelter!

Animal advocates have been upset about allegations surrounding the Animal Control and Care of New York City (NYC ACC). Allegations include animals being killed before they are available for adoption and before their hold times are up and animals being kept in filthy, inhumane conditions such as being kept in their own urine and feces. 

Advocates also allege that injured animals are left to suffer in the shelter untreated. In addition, they state that animals are often killed as soon as their owner leaves, which gives them no chance at all to ever be adopted. Advocates also claim that the shelter’s lead vet tech is not listed as being licensed with the New York State Department of Professions and that she is euthanizing animals daily.

The most shocking and heartbreaking allegation is that one or more employees are taking Pit Bull Terrier breeds home and using them to dog fight. One animal advocate states, “Employees take home animals whenever they want and many of them do not come back to the shelter. Instead they are reported as being missing, lost, or stolen. When they do come back, many have injuries.” In fact, on Maddie’s Fund’s website, in their 2012 annual report, it shows a high number of missing, lost, or stolen animals at this shelter.
