message: SPCA offers $13,000 reward for information on sickening video that shows goat being beheaded with a samurai sword

The Louisiana Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (LSPCA) has said it is investigating New Orleans' second goat beheading in two months - this one with a samurai-style sword.

LSPCA Spokeswoman Alicia Haefele said that on Tuesday, the LSPCA received a 12-second cellphone video showing young men around a kiddie pool where a goat is pulled into the air.

She said one man cuts off its head with the sword while the others cheer. 

The LSPCA described the video in a Wednesday release, saying 'While the men stand in a circle around the plastic swimming pool, string is tied around the goat’s neck and hanged from an above object. 

One man then beheads the goat while the other men cheer in the background and record the felony act with cell phones.
'Once beheaded, the goat’s legs continue to move while the body lies in the swimming pool and the head still hanging from the string. A few seconds later, the man who beheaded the goat picks up the body and the video clip ends.'

Haefele said this killing appears unrelated to the January 28 beheading of a baby pygmy goat. But she says it makes investigators wonder if the killings are part of a bigger trend.
Within hours, the LSPCA increased a reward for information about the case from $3,000 to $13,000. 

Destinie Hammond, a SPCA Communications Associate, told the New York Daily News 'If it turns out that this goat was killed for the purpose of consuming, that is not against the law; that's legal.
Hammond told the newspaper 'The fact that it was filmed is, of course, horrendous, but it was a very quick and clean kill so if it turns out that this was for consumption, unfortunately we can't really do anything about it.'  

The LSPCA said in a separate Wednesday release 'A tip was received by the Louisiana SPCA this afternoon stating the body of a goat was in the backyard of a house in the 700 block of Broadway Street.'

'The Louisiana SPCA, New Orleans Police Department and Tulane University Campus Police arrived on scene and did not discover any evidence linking to the cellphone video.'

The LSPCA said that tips can be submitted to the organization by dialing 504.368.5191 ext, 100.

Tulane spokesman Michael Strecker said in the release 'Tulane University is fully investigating this matter. At this time we have no evidence to suggest that this video involves or is related to any member of the Tulane community.

'We urge anyone who has any information regarding this video to contact the Tulane Police Department at 504-865-5381.'

The LSPCA said the New Orleans Police Department has no current official investigation going on.

New Orleans police said they have not received a complaint and are not investigating.
