description: Extreme Cruelty: Cooked Alive For Better Taste!

Every year more than 2.6 million cats (and dogs) are brutally killed and eaten in South Korea. Korean officials have stated that the eradication of cat dog and eating was achieved six different years: 1978, 1980, 1984, 1986, 1988, and 1991. The Korean Animal Protection law, approved on May 7, 1991 was set forth to prevent cat and dog eating, but is rarely enforced, thus the torture of these helpless animals continues to this day.......

It is horrifying and difficult to imagine that anywhere in the world vicious and torturous killings such as these still exist. Even though this research was extremely hard for me to report, people everywhere need to be made aware of the issue so we can all help put an end once and for all to the insanity.

In South Korea, cats are boiled alive and dogs are routinely blow torched to remove their fur and brown the skin. Their killings often include electrocution, hanging by the neck, and beatings with pipes and hammers. Sometimes cats may have their bones broken with a hammer before being boiled alive so that they can be made into a “health drink”. Cats are often beaten to death in a sack to make cat soup and boiled ALIVE for hours in a pressure cooker for medicinal purposes. These rituals seem like some barbaric act that could only be made up by some Hollywood writer. Unfortunately, for these animals, they are a cruel and terrifying reality.

Cats and dogs are kept in cages sometimes piled on top of one another with no room to move or defecate, and often under the dogs are the remains of animal carcasses. These animals are held captive within a nightmare on farms and in markets, where they can sometimes go days without food or water in these unsatisfactory conditions, as they await their terrible fate.

The cat and dog meat is an estimated $950 million per year industry in South Korea. Most of the animals are strays that are captured by butchers or other animal trade persons. 

The insanity of these cruel actions is unnecessary and by putting pressure on the South Korean government, we can insist the inhumane treatment of cats, and dogs, be stopped! Please sign the petitions:
