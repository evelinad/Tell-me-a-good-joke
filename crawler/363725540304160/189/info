description: URGENT: Freezing Temps Could Mean Death for ‘Outdoor Dogs’

First the cold hard facts: There are roughly 70 million stray dogs and cats in the U.S. at any given time. That works out to five homeless animals for every one homeless person living on the streets. These animals live in our cities, suburbs and rural neighborhoods. And for many, the food and shelter that they find during the winter will mean the difference between life and death.
 
Chances are, you have seen a few of these dogs and cats living outside in your own community. With cold weather approaching and a polar vortex in the forecast, it may be time to help.

If you see a dog in your neighborhood who is frequently chained outside or who looks to be deprived of adequate food, water, shelter or veterinary care, contact your local animal care and control organization or search for an animal shelter in your area:

Animal care officials will know the animal cruelty laws in your area, but even if none are being broken, they can often intervene and help the animal in other ways. Once you've reported the situation, don't be afraid to follow up; you may well be the dog's last hope.

Neglected and abandoned animals need our help in order to survive. Stray and feral cats should be captured and taken indoors. If a dog is being denied adequate food, water or shelter, please alert authorities right away.

If only humans opened their eyes and realized the fact that all other animals have just as much right to live as we do......... The voiceless are not trash — they are living beings! All life is precious! All life is equal! BE THEIR VOICE! SPEAK OUT! Help us spread the message, share us! If you agree that animals feel, suffer, love and the truth about their abuse should be exposed, please “like” our page.
