Hi all at Stop Animal Abuse, we are Animal Ark Ireland and we have been set up since 2012. We are all animal lovers and have set this group up to defend our Animals here in Ireland and also support other Animal Groups around the world. We also re-home animals and run a drop in time , for people who has lost a dog through death and who need to talk with us about it. We are really shocked and devastated by the upsurge in Animal Cruelty here in Ireland and we feel we must up our stand against the Abuse going on here. We have been handing out flyers warning people of the Dog napping, and the Cat snatching going on in Ireland and people just do not believe it. We need to get the media involved and also to get a voice in our Government regarding our Animal Cruelty legislation. We are asking the Public to support us by, Sharing our page, liking us, sending messages of support or donating for our cause to (paypal) Animalarkireland. We are sending some pictures of the latest Cruelty and abuse events that we have had the horror of dealing with. You are more then welcome to check out our face book page and see the work we do:
