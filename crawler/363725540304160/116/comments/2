I replied to an ignorant comment from someone that stated they don't understand why Ringling Brothers is retiring their elephants, because how else will anyone see the elephants, and I asked this person where they think these elephants come from, because they don't magically appear in the circus with the capacity to do tricks.  All of this only to be deleted.  And now they have stopped me from commenting at all.  Sometimes it's disheartening to be on a crusade through facebook where people can decide whether or not they want to see the truth.  I've posted this page on numerous other animal welfare pages, and this is the only page that has even tried to help me.  So thank you folks.", u'id': u'966903006653074_967909349885773', u'user_likes': False}
