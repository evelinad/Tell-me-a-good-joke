description: Dogs left chained outdoors found frozen 'solid' the next morning 

As the so-called "Polar Vortex" impacts a huge portion of the nation, officials are urging pet owners to bring their companions indoors to protect them from the harsh elements, and issuing reminders that despite having fur coat, dogs can still suffer deadly consequences from the cold.

Dogs who are forced to remain outdoors should be provided with adequate shelter and bedding to help protect them from the subzero temperatures and water must be checked frequently as it will quickly freeze.
