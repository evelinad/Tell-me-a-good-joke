description: Fighting to Protect Dogs and Cats in China


Owning a pet has only become popular in China in the past two decades and consequently, how to look after a pet responsibly is not widely known. Low awareness about the need for sterilization and vaccination results in pet overpopulation and rabies outbreaks. The situation is particularly serious in rural communities where dogs often go unleashed and rabies post-exposure treatment is often unavailable.

As a way to control rabies and pet populations, municipalities set up regulations to restrict pet ownership such as limiting the number and the size of dogs people can own. China does not have legislation to prevent cruelty to animals. Sometimes, local authorities enforce regulations by organizing dog-killing squads that roam the streets beating dogs to death with clubs. It is a slow and extremely distressing way for an animal to die and dogs are sometimes killed right in front of their owners.

It’s been reported that more than 2 million cats and dogs are killed each year for their meat. Many of them are previously owned animals and stolen from communities. On the way to restaurants, the animals are transported in deplorable conditions; with animals jammed into small cages without food and water and unable to move for days on end. Since dogs and cats are not considered farm animals, no quarantine standard is applied, so there is the danger that infectious diseases will spread to animals and people.
