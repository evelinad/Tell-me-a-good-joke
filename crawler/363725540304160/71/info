description: URGENT!!  CALL TO ACTION TO SAVE THE BEARS!
WE AGREE WITH FWC COMMISSIONER RON BERGERON who said he would like to see updated population numbers, which the FWC expects to have by summer of 2016, BEFORE making a decision on the hunt.
"The safety and welfare issue (of humans and bears) should be the most important issue here," Bergeron said. "Managing bear attractants – trash and other food sources – should also be a main focus," he added. "So many people like bears. Some want them hunted and some don't; the fact of the matter is, for the conflict, it's important for the public to know you have to manage your garbage."*

1.) EMAIL BearComments@myFWC.com AND Commissioners@myFWC.com with your OPPOSITION TO THE HUNT. Talking points are below and can also be found in prior posts:

i. Hunting is NOT EFFECTIVE in decreasing human-bear conflicts (HBC). This has been proven through numerous scientific studies. 
ii.  Non-lethal programs ARE EFFECTIVE in decreasing human-bear conflicts which has also been proven through numerous studies (including FWC's own).
iii. The population studies WILL NOT BE COMPLETE until June-September 2015-2016.
iv. Having a hunt is a knee jerk reaction to the recent human bear conflicts and is also catering to small minority of citizens who want to hunt bears. Public safety is key. The most effective method to ensure public safety and decrease HBC is through NON-LETHAL PROGRAMS.
2.) SIGN UP AND ATTEND A WEBINAR on March 26th, 6pm, to speak up for the bears. YOU MUST REGISTER IN ADVANCE.  After you sign up, you'll get confirmation and instructions from FWC for participation. WE HIGHLY URGE YOU TO PARTICIPATE AND BE A VOICE FOR THE BEARS.
Several pro-bear hunters were on the call and the bears need your rational voice. Sign up here: http://m.myfwc.com/wildlifehabitats/managed/bear/
