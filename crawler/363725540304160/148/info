description: When Children Abuse Animals 

*Studies show that acts of cruelty toward animals are the first signs of violent pathology that includes human victims. 

*Animal abuse is not just the result of a minor personality flaw in the abuser, but a symptom of a deep mental disturbance.

*The FBI has found that a history of cruelty to animals is one of the traits that regularly appear in its computer records of serial rapists and murderers. 

*Studies show that violent and aggressive criminals are more likely to have abused animals as children.

*Domestic abuse is directed toward the powerless; animal abuse and child abuse often goes hand and hand. 

*Children who abuse animals most likely are repeating a lesson learned at home from their parents or guardians. They are reacting to anger or frustration with violence.

*The child's violence is directed at the only individual in the family more vulnerable than themselves — an animal.
