description: HOW MUCH IS THE PUPPY IN THE WINDOW?

Did you know..........

*Where do most puppies sold in pet stores in the United States come from?

Puppy mills- facilities that breed dogs for profit. Estimates by several animal welfare groups are that 90 to 98% of puppies sold in pet stores come from kennels that breed puppies for profit, otherwise known as "puppy mills." 

*Many pet stores claim that their puppies do not come from "puppy mills," but from "licensed breeders." What is the difference?

There is none. Pet stores try to sugar-coat the sources of their puppies. "Licensed breeder" sounds much more clean and humane than "puppy mill." But, in reality, the two entities are the same- puppy mills, in order to be legal, *must* register with and be licensed by the USDA in order to sell their puppies to retail outlets. Thus, anyone selling to a pet store is a "licensed breeder."

*Legally, can a pet store in the United States turn away an unsuitable owner for a puppy?

Pet store puppies are merchandise, and are treated legally like any other merchandise. Thus, if a customer wishes to buy a puppy on impulse, but obviously has absolutely no puppy experience, lives in an apartment, works full-time, and cannot afford to care for the dog, the pet store cannot refuse to sell the person a puppy, or else they can be sued.

*What method do many U.S. pet stores use to urge their employees to sell more puppies?

Commission sales. Under the commission system, employees receive a cash commission for every puppy sold. Thus, the employees are encouraged to "push" puppies, even to people unsuitable for owning a stuffed toy, let alone a dog. Pet stores realize that the impulse buyers are their bread and butter.

*What disease is most prevalent among pet store dogs?

Kennel cough (bordetella). Kennel cough, a respiratory illness, is rampant in dogs kept in crowded and stressful conditions. While adult dogs can usually fight off the illness without severe consequences, it can be fatal in young puppies with underdeveloped immune systems. Pet store employees are trained to tell customers that the sick puppies "just have a little cold," and the sick pups are rarely isolated- they cannot be sold if the public cannot see them!

*Which United States county has the largest concentration of puppy mills?

Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. Amish farmers, more usually known for their horse-drawn vehicles and drab clothing, are infamous within the animal welfare community for their puppy mills. Many of these mills sell directly to consumers, and are thus not even USDA-registered. As the story "Amish Puppy Industry Draws Charges of Cruelty" http://www.newhouse.com/archive/murray112805.html documented: "Perhaps 60 fluffy white dogs were tucked in rabbit hutches stacked a story high and several dozen feet across. Scores of others filled dozens of pens stacked two-high on both sides of an alleyway. The sight of human visitors ignited a fury of yelps, and the dogs pawed their mesh cages." And, as one Amish farmer said, ""They (the outsiders) see their animals like people, give them the run of the house and let them jump on the bed at night -- and that's fine," John Stoltzfus said. "I've nothing against that. But out here, we're farmers, and our animals are animals."

*What state produces the most puppymill pups?

Missouri. According to www.nopuppymills.com, 52% of petstore pups come from Missouri and 23% from Kansas.

*What is the most common breed of dog in U.S. puppy mills?

Yorkshire terrier. In general, small dogs are more common in puppymills, as more can be raised in a small space. Dogs that are "free-whelping"- that deliver their pups without veterinary assistance- are also preferred.

*Which is not a usual fate of breeder dogs at puppymills when they are no longer needed?

Being donated to rescue groups that find them good homes. When a puppy mill no longer needs a dog, it has no financial incentive to keep the dog alive. Thus, it is either killed (often by being shot) or trucked to an auction and sold to the highest bidder.

*What happens to puppies in pet stores that do not sell before they grow too big to be cute?

All of these can happen (They are shipped back to the puppymill to be used as breeders, They are sent back to a broker and sold at auction, They are treated as "sale merchandise" and their prices are dropped until they sell). Pet stores demand a cute, tiny "product.' If a pup gets too big, it is no longer "cute." These pups are often returned to the dealer, which either sells the pups at auction, or ships them back to the originating mill, which can then use them as breeders. Sometimes, the prices are discounted deeply to try and "move" the pup.

*How big does the U.S. Department of Agriculture require a dog's cage to be, to be its legal lifetime living quarters?

Six inches longer than the length of the dog from the tip of the nose to the base of the tail.

*Under U.S. law, dogs with painful physical defects, such as open sores, tumors, or severe wounds, must be removed from breeding programs.

The Animal Welfare Act has no such requirement, and dogs rescued from puppy mills often have horrific injuries.

*What tactic do unethical pet stores *not* use to encourage people to buy their puppies?

Giving people honest information about the origin of their puppies, and the characteristics of the breeds that they sell. Pet store owners know that impulse buyers are their main buyers, thus they set up situations to encourage such impulse buying, such as asking people if they want to hold a puppy, or allowing children to be "puppy walkers." In addition, they know that people feel sorry for pups in small cages, and they encourage these sentiments, so that people will want to "rescue" the pup- in reality, just putting profit into the owner's pockets, and another puppy into the cage.
