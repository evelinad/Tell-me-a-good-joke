description: No one enjoys posting animal abuse photos, but post them to raise awareness and to remind people we can't stop fighting for the voiceless. Cruelty is out there and animals are suffering while some people are more concerned about their own feelings. I post them for the animals. If even one person becomes aware of these cruelties and speaks out, signs petitions, volunteers then it is well worth the gruesome photos.
