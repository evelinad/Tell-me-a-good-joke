description: How dangerous is antifreeze to pets? PLEASE SHARE THE IMPORTANT INFO- YOU CAN SAVE LIFE!

 
Winter conditions can present deadly dangers to dogs and cats, particularly one pet owners may not be aware of: antifreeze poisoning.

This sweet-tasting poison is unfortunately appealing to animals and consumption of a very small amount can lead to rapid kidney failure and death within a very short period of time.
 
Antifreeze is commonly used in car cooling systems and home plumbing systems to help maintain heat during winter months.
 
Pets may become exposed to antifreeze if it’s leaking from a car radiator onto a garage floor, driveway or the street. Pets can also gain access to antifreeze should it not be flushed from a home plumbing system or directly from the containers in your garage if they are not stored out of reach.
 
Antifreeze contains ethylene glycol, which is toxic to dogs and cats.

The metabolic products of the ethylene glycol cause severe damage to the pet’s kidneys, which then produce a toxic exposure to the central nervous system.

A very small amount of antifreeze is deadly to pets. For example, if your dog or cat walks through a puddle of antifreeze and then licks his paws, enough antifreeze can be ingested to cause death.
 
Immediate veterinary treatment is necessary to prevent the toxin from being absorbed into the pet’s liver!!!!!
 
Clinical signs of antifreeze exposure can occur in as little as 30 minutes and as long as 12 hours. Do not wait for symptoms to appear to go to your vet. Instead, if you have any concerns about potential ingestion, visit a vet immediately.

Symptoms include confusion, vomiting, an increase in thirst and urination, depression, lethargy, sores in the pet’s mouth and noticeable bad breath.
 
What you can do to Prevent Antifreeze Poisoning in Pets

Take preventive measures to keep your pets from accidental antifreeze poisoning:
 
*Keep antifreeze in sealed containers out of reach of pets. 
Dispose used antifreeze containers and rags in a garbage can pets can’t access or open. 

*Routinely check your garage floor and driveway for antifreeze leaks or spills. Cat litter is one way to absorb antifreeze leaks – dispose of it immediately after use, in a garbage bag that can be securely sealed. 

*After returning home from a walk, wash your pet’s paws in warm, soapy water in case he was unknowingly exposed to antifreeze while outside. 

*Switch to a pet-safe, propylene glycol based antifreeze. Although not 100% nontoxic, it’s considered less toxic than ethylene glycol based antifreezes. Several brands on the market include Sierra, Sta-Clean and Prestone LowTox Antifreeze/Coolant.

If you suspect your pet has been exposed to antifreeze, don’t hesitate — contact your veterinarian immediately to determine a course of action.
