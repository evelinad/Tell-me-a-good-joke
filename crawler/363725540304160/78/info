description: Just what is in that chicken nugget?

If you needed one more reason to quit chicken nuggets, well here it is! Researchers in Mississippi found two nuggets from two national fast food chains that were made up of 50 percent “good” chicken meat, and 50 percent of the grossest ingredients one can imagine. 

Sure, they were just two nuggets, as detractors of the findings point out, but do you really want to play Russian roulette when other less cruel and definitely healthier alternatives to blood vessels and skin exist? 

The nuggets came from two national fast food chains in Jackson. The three researchers selected one nugget from each box, preserved, dissected and stained the nuggets, then looked at them under a microscope.

The first nugget was about half muscle, with the rest a mix of fat, blood vessels and nerves. Close inspection revealed cells that line the skin and internal organs of the bird, the authors wrote in the American Journal of Medicine.

The second nugget was only 40 percent muscle, and the remainder was fat, cartilage and pieces of bone.

“We all know white chicken meat to be one of the best sources of lean protein available and encourage our patients to eat it,” lead author Dr. Richard D. deShazo of the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said.

“What has happened is that some companies have chosen to use an artificial mixture of chicken parts rather than low-fat chicken white meat, batter it up and fry it and still call it chicken,” deShazo told Reuters Health.

“It is really a chicken by-product high in calories, salt, sugar and fat that is a very unhealthy choice. Even worse, it tastes great and kids love it and it is marketed to them.”
