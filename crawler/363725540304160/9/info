description: REVLON is Not Cruelty Free!

I guess I’m a little late to the party on this one, but I wanted to write this for anyone who may not know. Revlon is conducting 3rd party testing and can no longer be considered cruelty free. This one really bothers me, because Revlon WAS one of the few cruelty free drugstore brands available.

Facts about Revlon:

Revlon has long been considered a cruelty-free company. However, in recent years Revlon has opened up cosmetic manufacturing in China, where animal testing is compulsory. When asked whether the company is testing on animals in China, Revlon representatives responded by saying, “Revlon is in full compliance with all applicable laws and regulations related to animal testing.” This arbitrary statement has led consumers to believe that Revlon is hiding the fact that it now tests on animals.

PETA has recently withdrawn its endorsement of Revlon as a cruelty-free company, now claiming that the company does indeed test on animals. PETA also recently bought a large share of Revlon’s stock so that they could determine once and for all whether Revlon is abusing animals for the sake of beauty.

An independent manufacturer who sells ingredients to Revlon to make cosmetics also reported that Revlon recently ordered tests on 50 animals. These tests involve injecting rabbits or mice over and over again until the subjects die in order to determine at what concentration the product is lethal.

Animal testing is an outdated practice that is no longer necessary to ensure the safety of cosmetics. Alternative methods, such as using human cells, are readily available and equally effective. There is no reason in this modern world that animals need to be tortured for the sake of beauty products. Further, Revlon needs to come clean to its consumers about animal testing once and for all.
