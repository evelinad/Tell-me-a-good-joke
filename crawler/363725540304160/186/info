description: Major dog food company Purina is being sued for killing 4,000 dogs with its toxic dog food Beneful.

This is not the first time Purina has been accused of producing a harmful product. Years ago, Purina was initially accused of using the harmful food additive, propylene glycol, in its food.

This time, those suing Purina believe that the culprit is mycotoxin, a toxic byproduct of mold. Although the presence of mycotoxin in Beneful has not yet been proven with tests, thousands of cases have shown that dogs eating Purina have been suffering from symptoms such as hair loss, vomiting, liver failure, and eventually death.

Read on for more about the Purina lawsuit, and learn how you can protect your furry friends from potentially harmful toxins.
