description: Is Your Beauty Worth the Lives of 11.5 Million Innocent Animals? Think twice before buying cosmetics……

When a woman whose main job requirement is to be beautiful expresses that animal testing for the sake of vanity is wrong, you have to wonder what lawmakers were thinking.

The controversy surrounding animal testing for cosmetic and personal products always brings out passions. Do you remember the Urban Decay backlash when they wanted to sacrifice their cruelty-free standing in order to enter the Chinese market (where animal testing was required by law) and the second wave of backlash when they sold to L’Oréal? While L’Oréal insists that it is committed to ending animal testing, they do admit to making exceptions where animal testing is required by law. They also have a history of not being totally transparent.

If the United States’ Safe Cosmetics and Personal Care Products Act of 2013 (SCPCPA) goes into effect, then cue more passionate backlash.

11.5 million animals will be tortured, and, most likely, killed for the safety of your vanity.

L’Oréal always reminds us that we are ‘worth it,’ but aren’t those 11.5 million animals’ lives worth it, too?
