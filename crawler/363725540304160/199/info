description: FUR – The Ugly Face Of Fashion


DESPITE a wealth of alternatives, many fashion designers have resumed using real fur in their collections, turning their backs on the shocking suffering endured by animals reared on fur farms. An undercover investigation released by Animal Defenders International (ADI), shows over 30 Finnish fur farms visited in the past twelve months, and dispels myths about how animals used for fur are raised.

Foxes and mink are wild animals, and on fur farms they cannot cope with life in barren metal cages. Many exhibit abnormal behaviour. Worse still, the conditions on these farms are disgusting, and the animals’ short, miserable lives are spent in squalid surroundings, where they suffer injuries, infections and deformities. Finland is the largest supplier of fox fur pelts in the world, producing almost half of the fox fur in circulation.

Fur Is Eco-Unfriendly

Did you know that more than 60 times as much energy is needed to produce fur coats from ranch-raised animals than is needed to produce fake furs? And that’s just the beginning.

The waste produced on fur farms where animals spend their entire lives in cramped, filthy cages, constantly pacing back and forth from stress and boredom is poisoning our waterways. In December 1999, for example, the Washington Department of Ecology fined one mink farmer $24,000 for polluting ditches that drain into a local creek.

The Environmental Protection Agency has also filed complaints against companies involved in fur production and transportation for illegally generating and disposing of hazardous waste from processing pelts. Improper handling of waste can cause water contamination. The fur industry has even lobbied governments in the Great Lakes area to maintain low water-quality standards so that fur farms won’t be identified as major polluters.

Furriers claim that the carcasses from animals skinned for their pelts are used for animal feed (even though many animals on fur farms are killed by being injected with poisons), but often they end up dumped in landfills. A fur farm in Great Britain was accused of violating waste-disposal laws after a local resident found skinned mink carcasses in a landfill there. Although wasteful, this method of disposal would not be illegal in the United States.

What can I do?

Boycott designers/shops who are using/selling fur products and tell them to stop supporting cruelty.

Use the information provided in this article to counter claims that the fur industry has cleaned up its act and that animals raised in captivity don’t know any better.

Write to newspapers describing why you think fur (and fur trim) is disgusting.

Remember – animal industries are designed to maximise profits – always at the expense of the animal’s welfare and comfort, and always at the expense of their lives.
