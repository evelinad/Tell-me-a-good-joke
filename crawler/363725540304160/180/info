message: Wolf And Donkey Friendship

In 2007, in the village of Patok, Albania, a wolf had been captured from the mountains and was being held in a cage. A villager put a donkey in the cage with the wolf, intending that the donkey should become a live meal… but that didn’t happen.

Instead, the wolf and the donkey became close companions, refusing to harm each other and cohabitating peacefully in the cage. After a flurry of media attention (including a successful petition from Care2), the Albanian government intervened, and the wolf was returned to the wild. The donkey was allowed to live out its life in a comfortable open pasture—and the wolf still passes by sometimes to see him!

This is an older story, but it still touches me. I hope it brightens your day, too!
