But I am shocked at many of the responses. It is an utterly horrific thing that this young boy did to a defenceless animal & of course he has to be punished.. .Do some of the things people are suggesting should happen to him make them any better than him I wonder?  Someone disagreed when I said he needed psychiatric help, he is a child, we do not know what sort of life he has had & it seems we do not care.... By the responses mob rule has taken over. We rightly have compassion for the poor dog & rightly feel indignation at what the boy did, but unless we try to understand & help the ones that do this what hope is there for human kind. The way forward is not to do as they do, but to help & most importantly educate them...', u'id': u'965901530086555_966032480073460', u'user_likes': False}
