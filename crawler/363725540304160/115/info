POISONING ONCE AGAIN IN THE CENTER OF TOWN! SILKE IS ON HER WAY!

This was the sight, midday, in front of a public school with children in the yard in full view of this horror.  An animal slowly, violently dies flooded with  excrutiating pain.  
The image burned into the children's minds creating a permanent impression. 
The next gruesome image these children might encounter might not be so bad or might be worse but one thing is certain, it has made its impression and it has graduated this audience from their naive, playful, carefree worlds to a world of violence, anxiety and death.

THIS IS NOT AN ANIMAL WELFARE MOVEMENT, THIS IS A COMMUNAL MOVEMENT. WE DO NOT ACCEPT SUCH IMAGES IN OUR COMMUNUNITY, WE DO NOT ACCEPT SUCH DANGEROUS ACTIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY.  WE DO NOT ACCEPT INDIFFERENCE!

Sunday 15th of March at the fountain in the Old Harbor of Chania a gathering to make the community aware of the poisonings that have been occurring in town and making it clear that this is NOT ACCEPTABLE. All local animal welfare groups will be there. Make sure you will too!
Please share....
