message: Carpenter Fired For Rescuing a Raccoon: Demand He Get His Job Back!

When Care2 user Mathilda heard that a carpenter in San Francisco had been fired after he performed a beautiful act of kindness by rescuing a trapped raccoon, she was outraged and decided to start a Care2 petition demanding the 49-year-old carpenter’s reinstatement. It turns out thousands of people from all over the world share her outrage and want justice.

So far, over 20,000 activists from countries including Thailand, France, Mexico, and New Zealand, have added their signatures to Mathilda’s petition, voicing their fury that instead of being praised for his act of kindness, this man was fired.
