The dogs were not trained properly of righteousness and wrongfulness. dogs are similar minded to children. That is why i feel it not righteous to destroy the dogs. The owner should be arrested and be banned from owning dogs. Dogs do what they must to make the only family they have happy. Very similar to children of what they do to have their parents feel proud. This is why dogs should be taken into a logical manner and not bias or discriminate them. Dogs have done less harm than people to the environment and humans. To understand dogs is difficult for those themselves who were not taught the truth and kindness of animals. It is true some animals do not know better, but some can be taught how to live peacefully with animal and humans. If some are christian, remember jesus did say accept all, and saint francis accepted all animals and saw the good in them. Peace without violence makes a balance, it never easy, but it worth it. I do feel sorry for the cat... My prayers for the family. I pray better owners will prevent future deaths.', u'id': u'970778432932198_970817166261658', u'user_likes': False}
