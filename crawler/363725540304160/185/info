description: No matter where you are in this journey; whether you have already cut back on eating meat or are just starting to consider what that might be like- get ready for some wonders! Taking animals out of your plate is a miracle for your health, body and spirit! Do not allow others' greed of profit to brainwash you. Don't sponsor the industry that promotes unnecessary suffering. Stop consuming dead, abused flesh of other beings. Make a commitment to your health and to your soul. Compassion starts with you. Right here, right now - that's all you have.
