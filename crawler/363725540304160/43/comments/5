She needs to hear a few choice words directly face to face, and not wait for the owner to leave before stating their disgust on FB. To this mean lady, she basically got away with animal abuse and disrespect right in front of animal lovers and at an Aniaml shelter. She should of never been allowed to walk away without at least being told that her behavior is uncalled for and unacceptable! Prayers for this sweet baby to find a forever loving home soon.', u'id': u'973445799332128_973477622662279', u'user_likes': False}
