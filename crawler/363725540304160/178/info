description: Texas fireman: 'Keep your damn dogs on your property'

In a disturbing photo being circulated on social media of two dead dogs admittedly killed by a volunteer of the Union Valley Fire Department in Texas, the Hunt County constable announced on Wednesday, they are currently conducting an investigation of alleged animal cruelty, reports the HeraldBanner.com.

The upsetting photo was posted on Tuesday to volunteer fireman Tim Conaster's Facebook with the following comment where he alleged he killed two neighborhood dogs. A screen shot of the caption states:

"Somebody didn't put any truth my warning. [sic] Keep your damn dogs on your property."

As the photo and the comments garnered more attention, the Union Valley Fire Department's Facebook lit up with complaints and disgust over the behavior of one of their firemen. Most of the comments have since been removed, however the organization posted the following statement about the situation:

"As previously stated, we do not condone the recent actions of one of our firefighters," Union Valley Volunteer Fire Department said on their Facebook page. "We are following our policy in removing him from our department. This is now a civil/criminal matter that we have no jurisdiction over. Please forward all concerns to local law enforcement and/or the SPCA."

On Wednesday morning, the Union Valley Volunteer Fire Department posted more information about the extremely distressing situation:

"Allegedly, a member of the Union Valley Fire Department posted a boast on Facebook claiming that he killed 2 dogs on his property. He included pictures of the deceased dogs. His Facebook identified himself as a fireman and claimed that he lived in Royse City. We have received a deluge of angry emails and phone calls this morning.

To set the record straight…. the person has been suspended as a Union Valley fireman, and lives outside of our city limits. Any offense did not occur within Royse City jurisdiction."

In conjunction with the Hunt County Sheriff's Office, Constable Terry Jones and the Texas SPCA are investigating the situation.

According to Sheriff Meeks, a person does have the right to use lethal force if an animal presents a danger to someone's property, animals or people. If there is no danger, the person can be charged with animal cruelty. There are no leash laws in Hunt County.

“I don’t know why people post things on social media, but they do,” stated Sheriff Meeks.
