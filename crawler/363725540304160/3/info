description: Animal Intelligence and Heroism

Scarlett the Fire Hero Kitty: a female cat who rose to such heights of heroism, she inspired the creation of the Scarlett Award for Animal Heroism.

Her story begins in an abandoned garage-turned-crackhouse in ye olde Brooklyn, circa 1996. Less than two years old herself, Scarlett gave birth to a litter of five kittens, ranging in color from snowy white to black as a starless night. We’ll never know who the father was, but Scarlett left us no room to doubt who the rightful mother of these kittens was with the rousing display of maternal love and undaunted courage she displayed one fateful night as her home caught fire, trapping her helpless newborns inside.

“What she did was she ran in and out of that building five times, got them all out, and then started moving them one by one across the street,” 17-year veteran firefighter David Giannelli recalls. As she made each trip, Scarlett suffered worsening injuries, from fur-singing third degree burns over most of her body to blistered-shut eyelids. Her sight gone, Scarlett performed a head count of each of her kittens by touching her nose to their heads once they had reached safety across the street.

Sadly, the weakest white-coated kitty of Scarlett’s litter succumbed to an ensuing virus some weeks later. However, her four other kittens survived and thrived under the care of the North Shore Animal League and families eager to adopt these miraculous felines. And, though she suffered some permanent disfiguration as a result of the fire, Scarlett herself went on to regrow most of her fur and live to the ripe old age of 13, after being adopted by a woman who had lost her own cat in a car accident.

Scarlett passed away in 2008, but her kitties are not her only surviving legacy: through the award established in her honor and the millions of lives she has touched with her inspiring story, Scarlett has become an immortal symbol of the lengths that living creatures of all shapes, sizes, and species will go to care for those they love.

The North Shore Animal League has created an award – Scarlett Award for Animal Heroism – in Scarlett’s honor. It is presented to animals that have engaged in heroic acts to benefit others, whether humans or other animals.
