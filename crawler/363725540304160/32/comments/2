How can so many ppl torture an innocent animal to this extent. Burn it and keep it alive to suffer more. I've have never felt this way as I do now. I would have no problem going to this place and shooting every single person involved. None of them deserve to live one more day, one more minute.  Why? Why would an entire community commit such a beyond sickening act of violence.  I signed but I feel it's not enough. I pray to God this NEVER happens again and these ppl are simply disposed and will suffer in the lake of fire for all eternity!", u'id': u'974005689276139_974033175940057', u'user_likes': False}
