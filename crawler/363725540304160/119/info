description: FACTS: Every year, more than 50 MILLION fur-bearing animals are brutally KILLED for FASHION

China is one of the world’s largest suppliers of animal skins.  More than 95 percent of China’s finished fur garments are exported for sale overseas, and more than half are sold in the United States. 

No federal humane slaughter law or restrictions exist to protect animals on fur factory farms and killing methods are gruesome, resulting in unbearable torment and excruciating deaths of innocent animals who watch their fellow cage mates as they are coldly and callously killed in front of their innocent eyes.

The globalization of the fur trade has made it impossible to know where fur products come from.  Even if a fur garment’s label says it was made in a European country, the animals were likely raised and slaughtered elsewhere – in a majority of the cases, on an unregulated Chinese fur farm.

Would you wear your dog or cat?  The dog and cat fur trade in China is unspeakable.  The animals languish in tiny cages, piled on top of one another, transported in deplorable conditions – many still with collars on, stolen from their guardians, someone’s beloved companion, so that their skins can be turned into coats, trim, and trinkets.

Canada’s annual seal ‘hunt’ is the largest slaughter of marine mammals on the planet.  More than one million baby seals killed in the past three years, almost all of them as young as 12 days, too young to know how to swim to save their lives – over 95% of the pups killed were under 3 months of age — the majority killed before they have eaten their first solid meal.

Contrary to fur industry propaganda, fur production destroys the environment.  The amount of energy needed to produce a real fur coat is approximately 20X more than needed to produce a fake fur garment, nor is fur biodegradable due to the chemical treatment applied to stop the skins from rotting.  The process of using these chemicals is also dangerous because it causes water contamination.

The majority of fur-trimmed products and items (even trinkets) labeled as “faux fur” or “synthetic” may be real fur, mostly from cats and dogs.
