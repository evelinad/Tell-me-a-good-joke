description: THE HORROR OF ANIMAL TESTING FOR COSMETICS

Watching suffering is horrible. Especially when the suffering is not neutral.  If we watch an animal in pain our humanity forces us to care: do something to help, to lessen the suffering. If that animal is put into a position of pain because of something we did or did not do their suffering is no longer neutral.  In some way their suffering becomes our fault.

It is horrible that these animals are being so tortured and abused, but its even sadder that people who know about this don't care about the animals they just want to know if the company got sued or something like that. I remember the saying that says 'treat others the way you want to be treated" what happened to that? I mean would you want to have your blood drawn so many times over the course of the day that your vein becomes deformed? Would you want people stuffing tubes up your nose and down your stomach to pump chemicals into your stomach, chemicals that will kill you, day after day?

We need your help to urge the cosmetics industry, federal regulators, and Congress to put a stop to this. Americans should have the same level of cutting–edge science used in the EU, Israel, and India to evaluate the safety of our cosmetics products, and we also deserve to have our laws reflect our ethical stance that animals should never be forced to suffer and die in cosmetics tests.

Here’s a comprehensive list of companies that do not test on animals. This list is compiled and is updated several times a year by PETA. Those marked with an asterisk (*) manufacture strictly vegan products—made without animal ingredients, such as milk and egg byproducts, slaughterhouse byproducts, lanolin from sheep, honey, or beeswax.
