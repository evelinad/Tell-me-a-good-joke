description: Palm Oil - Choose Cruelty Free

Your shampoo, your ice cream, your margarine, your lipstick -- all contain palm oil. Demand is still growing, as are oil palm plantations... but at what price to tropical forests and the biodiversity found there?

I invite you to recall your most recent grocery list. Odds are, you have a number of packaged goods including some chips, cookies, cake mix, canned soup, or even baby formula? What you may not know is that many of these items have palm oil in the ingredient list.

Palm oil is now present in more than half of consumer packaged goods found in grocery stores across the U.S. The market’s increasing demand for palm oil has threatened the existence of rainforests around the world, specifically those located in Southeast Asia.

Destruction of the earth’s ecosystem also means endangering the lives of iconic species who live there, including the red-listed Sumatran and Borneo orangutans. Orangutans are said to be among our closest kin in the animal kingdom, and we’re slowly killing the species off without even realizing it. 

Today’s population of orangutans exists only in shrinking areas of rainforests in the Sumatra and Borneo islands of Southeast Asia. About 80 percent of the rainforest there has already been destroyed by human hands. Researchers on both islands have reached the conclusion that without drastic change in plantation practices, both orangutan species face inevitable extinction.

There are approximately 54,000 Borneo orangutans left in the wild. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has labelled them as an endangered species, yet their numbers continue to fall. More than 20 percent of the small forest area they call home has already been dedicated to palm oil plantations, with additional areas also at risk.

Researchers predict that half of the Borneo’s habitat will be lost due to the development of palm oil plantations, timber plantations, and other factors. This is without accounting for illegal expansion of industries further into the forests than they are allowed.

The story is even more disheartening for the Sumatran orangutan, of which only 6,600 are still wild and free. The IUCN Red List has categorized the Sumatran orangutan as critically endangered, meaning the species faces the highest possible threat of extinction.

These animals are one of the world’s 25 most endangered primates and we’re destroying their only habitat left on this Earth. If nothing changes soon, they will become extinct.

Palm oil plantations also harbor extreme environmental threats. Among the issues raised included peatland drainage and drastic carbon emissions, repercussions from the smoke and fire used to clear the land for planting with palm oil, as well as contributions to climate change.

Worldwide, tropical deforestation contributes as many emissions to climate change as those from the global transportation sector. That’s equivalent to the pollutants coming out of the engine of every car, truck, ship, plane, and train on the planet.

So the question remains: how do we stop the disappearance of our closest kin from the face of the planet, as well as the destruction of the precious amount of rainforests we have left? The answer is simple. We need to raise public awareness about the issue, calling for the people to take a stand against the “Snack Food 20″ companies, requiring them to take safe and regulated measures in palm oil manufacturing. 

The fate of orangutans rests largely in our hands and our simple day to day decisions.
