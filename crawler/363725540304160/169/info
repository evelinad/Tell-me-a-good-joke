description: The Horror of Animal Experimentation: research into radiation damage!


Motivated by the plans for the building of new nuclear plants, Jydsk Atomkraft A/S has in cooperation with the EU's Center For Radiation Hygiene initiated a series of experiments to establish the extent of which long-term exposure to low levels of radioactive radiation will affect the tissues of living organisms.

The purpose of the experiments is to study how short, and in particular long-term, exposure of as well the entire body as well as isolated areas and organs to low levels of radiation affects the cells.

In the experiments, kittens are exposed to varying levels of radiation in short or long periods of time to study the effects. The cats will be strapped to a steel grid during the experiments in order to facilitate focusing of the radiation on specific parts of the body and thereby study how the individual organs are affected.

Kittens are especially "well suited" for these experiments as the metabolism of cats, and in particular kittens, causes radiation damage to develop very rapidly and the researchers will be able to study the radiation damage effects clearly after relatively brief exposures.

The use of cats is also highly cost-effective as the Danish law for protection of animals ("Dyreværnsloven") allows JAAS to capture any cats on the company's ground. And the use of cats in medicinal experiments is legal as long as the cats are properly fed and cared for and not subjected to "unnecessary suffering"……..

Approximately 115 million animals are used as experimental instruments or "guinea pigs" and are killed in the United States every year. Much of the experimentation include pumping chemicals into rats' stomach, hacking muscle tissues from dogs' thighs, and putting baby monkeys in isolation chambers far from their mothers. These experiments are paid by the American taxpayers and consumers. In contrast, you cannot visit a laboratory and see how the government has spent the taxpayers' money.

Animal experimentation is a multi-billion dollar industry fueled by massive public funding and involving corporate, government, and university laboratories, cage, and food manufacturers. The industry and the experimenters profit because animals, who cannot defend themselves against abuse, are legally imprisoned and exploited.
