Jerry was so depressed and moped around the house for weeks. My mom was working full time and he was lonely. He didn't get better until I brought my mom a 7 week old schnauzer puppy. As soon as Jerry heard puppy sounds he ran over to see and after that he was much better because he had a baby to take care of and wasn't lonely anymore.", u'id': u'966245796718795_966660510010657', u'user_likes': False}
