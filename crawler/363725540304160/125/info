message: Lion trophy ban won't work!

Banning the importation of lion trophies from Africa won't actually have an impact in improving conservation, according to shooters.

A decision by Environment Minister Greg Hunt to ban the trade is designed to discourage the practice of canned hunting, in which animals are bred in captivity so they can be killed for a fee.

The Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia believes the announcement is more about politics than helping to stop the practice, which it says can only be tackled on the ground.
Policies which cause wildlife to lose its economic value to local communities in Africa can open the door for poachers, the association's Matt Godson said in a statement.

The group has offered to help develop a policy which would better target unethical hunting.

Current regulations in South Africa mean businesses normally only allow "photo-trophies" and that will continue despite Mr Hunt's announcement, Mr Godson said.

Under the government's ban Australians who participate in canned hunting will be unable to bring their trophies home.
