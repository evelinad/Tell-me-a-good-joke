description: Overloading weighs heavy on the backs of working horses and donkeys 

Around the world millions of horses, donkeys and mules are put to work in brick kilns, city streets, tourist sites and remote villages. They face unforgiving terrain and long hours, without regular breaks or access to shade or water, experiencing exhaustion and dehydration.

Horse owners in many parts of the world do not have the knowledge, skills or income to put the welfare of their animals first.

Working horses often receive little or no veterinary care. They are frequently:

*Kept in poor conditions with a lack of nutritional food.
*Poorly shod, resulting in lameness.
*Overloaded, or forced to pull unroadworthy carts.
*Infested with parasites.
*Worked for long hours in high temperatures, without rest or water.

How you can help

When travelling, avoid the use of pack animals or taking donkey and horse rides where burdens are heavy and conditions poor.
