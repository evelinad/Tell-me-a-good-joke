description: Hen Intelligence

Leading animal behavior scientists from around the globe know that chickens are inquisitive and interesting animals whose cognitive abilities are in some cases more advanced than those of cats, dogs, and even some primates. 

Like all animals, chickens love their families and value their own lives. The social nature of chickens means that they are always looking out for their families and for other chickens in their group. People who have spent time with chickens know that they have complex social structures, adept communication skills, and distinct personalities, just as we do.

They can complete complex mental tasks, learn from watching each other, demonstrate self-control, worry about the future, and even have cultural knowledge that is passed from generation to generation. 

Chickens comprehend cause-and-effect relationships and understand that objects still exist even after they are hidden from view. In this respect, they are more cognitively advanced than small human children (PETA)

Next time you’re elbow deep in an enormous bucket of fried chicken, take a second to consider the intelligence of the bird who gave their life for the lard-laden meal. A recent study from Britain suggests chickens are relatively practical thinkers and even make excellent students.

Although chickens probably won’t be taking up calculus anytime soon, their intelligence poses a lot of questions regarding the treatment of farm animals. If these birds show even the slightest indication of intelligence, who’s to say they aren’t emotionally distraught due to their caged environments? Read Nicholas D. Kristof’s personal account of farm bird intelligence at the link below:
