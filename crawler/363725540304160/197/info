description: Mums are Mums. Whether human, bear, chicken or pig - a mother nurtures, protects and teaches her young to function and survive in the world. From first steps to survival skills, animal moms teach their babies the same lessons as human moms. Seals learn how to swim by riding on their mothers' backs. Lion cubs learn to hunt, baby bears learn what berries they can eat and how to snatch fish out of streams. All mothers teach their young to be independent, productive adults who support themselves.

Watch the funny video how rhino mum teaches her baby how to take a mud bath ;)
