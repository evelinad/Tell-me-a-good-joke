Please boycott retailers who sell fur products. No animal should ever suffer such a hideous and violent death, ever!  We are the paying consumers- we create the demand! Don't contribute to animal suffering. Help us spread the message, share us! If you agree that animals feel, suffer, love and the truth about their abuse should be exposed, please “like” our page. Thank you!  https://www.facebook.com/pages/Animal-Cruelty-Exposed/363725540304160
