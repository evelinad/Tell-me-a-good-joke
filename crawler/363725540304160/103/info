description: TRUTH ABOUT COLORED CHICKS: EASTER FUN

Dyeing eggs has long been an Easter tradition.

I'm not sure who came up with the idea of dyeing baby chicks a rainbow of colors as if they were Easter eggs, but whoever it was sounds sick to me.

Animal activists are outraged, as they should be. The mere description of how chick dyeing works is enough to make anyone with a soul cringe: The dye is either injected in the incubating egg (uggghhh) or sprayed on the hatchling. 

Poultry farmers claim that it is harmless (as long as the dye is nontoxic), but please! How could that possibly be true?

Even if the dye is actually nontoxic and it doesn't pose health problems for the poor little chicks, the practice itself makes it so these chicks are treated like disposable "playthings" -- not living creatures.

Sure, researchers use dye all the time to track birds, and teachers have dyed chick for classroom use to show students how feathers come in. But dyeing chicks just for the sole purpose of making them cute for Easter seems to take the practice to a whole new, disgraceful level.

There's nothing redeeming about using chemicals to mess with Mother Nature and dye a helpless animal for five seconds of fun. It's a cruel, unnecessary practice that should be halted ASAP. More power to the animal activists. We should all hope their call for justice is heard.

These baby birds are actually dyed while in the egg with hyrdrogen peroxide, ammonia or food colouring that is injected into the shell! This is cruel!

Here's a video of what the poor little chicks look like after spraying:

Don't buy live Easter season animals! Many of these animals are also abandoned in parks, or on the street, where they may die or face abuse. Fielding urged parents who want to teach their children about spring babies or responsible pet ownership to give them non-living presents, such as stuffed animals, art supplies, books or other educational materials.

Families who are able to support an animal are urged to adopt instead of purchasing a pet. PLEASE SHARE THE MESSAGE!
