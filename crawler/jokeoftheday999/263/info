message: MEN WILL NEVER WIN

If you work too hard, there is never any time for her.. 
If you don't work enough, you are a good for nothing bum. 

If she has a boring repetitive job with low pay, it is exploitation. 
If you have a boring repetitive job with low pay, you should get off your rear and find something better. 

If you get a promotion ahead of her, it's favoritism. 
If she gets job ahead of you, it's equal opportunity. 

If you mention how nice she looks, it's sexual harassment.
If you keep quiet, it's male indifference. 

If you cry, you are a wimp. 
If you don't, you are an insensitive bastard. 

If you make a decision without consulting her, you are a chauvinist. 
If she makes a decision without consulting you, she's liberated woman. 

If you ask her to do something she doesn't enjoy, that's domination. 
If she asks you, it's a favor. 

If you appreciate the female form and frilly underwear, you are a pervert. 
If you don't, you are gay. 

If you like a woman to shave her legs and keep in shape, you are a sexist. 
If you don't, you are unromantic. 

If you buy her flowers, you are after something. 
If you don't, you are not thoughtful. 

If you are proud of your achievements, you are full of yourself. 
If you don't, you are not ambitious. 

If she has a headache, she is tired. 
If you have a headache, you don't love her anymore.
