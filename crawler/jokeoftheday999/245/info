message: 1)Racism will never end as long as white cars are still using black tires. 

2.Racism will never end As long as white bread still costs more than brown bread.

3.Racism Will never end as long we still wash first white clothes, then other colors later

4.Racism will never end if people still use BLACK to symbolise bad luck and WHITE for peace!

5.Racism will never end if people still wear white clothes to weddings and black clothes to the funerals

6.Racism will never end as long as those who don't pay their bills are Blacklisted not Whitelisted. Even when playing the pool (snooker), you haven't won until you sink the black ball, and the white ball must remain on the field.

BUT I DON'T CARE, JUST AS LONG AS I'M STILL USING THE WHITE TOILET PAPER TO WIPE MY ASS, I'M STILL FINE!
