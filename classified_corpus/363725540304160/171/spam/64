How DARE people waste your time like that? Instead of allowing you to continue trying to HELP innocent creatures, they have to get in your way. They could be reporting all the people who sell animals on FB, who put photos and videos on of them abusing animals or supporting animal use and abuse. Hell, they could be reporting spousal and child abuse, racism, pornograpphy, sexism, cyber bullying. There are so many issues that they could be addressing, so much help they could be giving. But no, they are reporting you for trying to save lives and see justice done. What is wrong with their minds?!', u'id': u'960303287313046_960850387258336', u'user_likes': False}
