They won't take down pages that promote abuse of animals, yet those who bring that to the attention of the public are harassed.  I recently signed a petition to have FB include a report animal abuse button on their site.  Maybe with enough people requesting this, we can at least put an end to pages that glorify animal abuse. https://www.change.org/p/facebook-demand-facebook-includes-a-report-animal-cruelty-button?utm_medium=email&utm_source=notification&utm_campaign=new_petition_recruit#share", u'id': u'960303287313046_960352627308112', u'user_likes': False}
