Breeding \nexacerbates the overpopulation of domesticated animals ten-fold.   Breeders refuse to acknowledge their contribution to the overpopulation....which contributes to the death and destruction of millions of dogs and cats, annually.   The breeder cannot see past the money which keeps them ignorant to the death and blood on their hands.   Breeders will argue that they "love" their little money makers but the true test of love is to spay and neuter their animals and find a real job.', u'id': u'960016584008383_960418000634908', u'user_likes': False}
