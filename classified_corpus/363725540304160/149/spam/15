Only qualified experienced rescue groups or legitimate responsible animal shelters should be finding new homes for unwanted animals. Handing animals over to unknown rescue groups who have not been thoroughly checked out is just as irresponsible and we won't do it. Anyone giving pets away on their own should follow Pet Adoption Guidelines which always includes A HOME VISIT. Humane shelter euthanasia is far better than being tortured and drowned. If those denouncing shelters would spend their time implementing and supporting spay neuter laws aimed at eliminating dog cat overpopulation we could end dog cat overpopulation and end the suffering. But when you don't believe pet overpopulation exists I guess that type of common sense effort won't work. Don't let the inexperienced animal advocates among us sentence defenseless animals to torture. We must urge people to stop demonizing shelters and shelter workers, for the sake of the helpless animals. Please share this.
