Too many times, animal responsibilities are given solely to a child to take on and this is not right at so many levels. What could you do when the adults you and your dog relied on failed you! I didn't do what you did, but had a similar experience. For my 9th birthday, I was given a puppy. I didnt know a single thing about raising animals, let alone a dog or puppy training. This puppy was 100% my responsibility. No parent involvement what so ever. And the pup grew fast. Within months she was too big and too high strung for a 9yr old child to walk or control. Within a year, my parents forced me to make her live outdoors in a dog house on a chain. And still, all the responsibility was up to me- feeding, watering, exercise, health care. I was overwhelmed and couldn't keep up. Unfortunately, she had to be humanely put down shortly after moving her outdoors because she contacted a disease from a tick. After I lost her, I made a vow to myself to learn everything possible about animal care, focussing on dogs. When I turned 14yrs, I adopted a pup from a shelter, and again I took on 100% of the animals care. This time, I knew what I was doing, understood it was my parents fault for a lot of the things that happened in the past with my first dog, and was able to be a successful, caring dog owner. This dog changed my life forever. You keep doing what your doing, rescuing strays and helping animals who need it. I believe in you!", u'id': u'972438119432896_972493799427328', u'user_likes': False}
