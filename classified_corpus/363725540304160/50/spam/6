Well that is on her! She was horrible to not take that poor dog to the vet!! Think of the pain it was in, if it's face was half eaten away, later on? OMGs I feel sorry for the boy, I do not feel sorry for the MOM!! I am glad you went and found the stray and are making amends for Brownie! We all make mistakes, and I do not think you actually relished killing Brownie....still I am glad you cared enough to put it down, and I for one, forgive you! May your life now be blessed by the amazing love of animals!", u'id': u'972438119432896_972473506096024', u'user_likes': False}
