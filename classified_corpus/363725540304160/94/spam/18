I see horrible stories like this, and I'm honestly ashamed to be a member of the same species - the capacity some so-called humans have for cruelty to animals never ceases to shock and sadden me. I feel so sad for the living, breathing, feeling animals that have suffered at the hands of men. I feel such anger and even hatred towards those men who would inflict such pain and suffering on an animal that wants only to love and be loved. My mind cannot comprehend such behavior, such lack of compassion. I wonder what goes on in the mind of such sick people who torture, neglect, abuse and fight animals with no sympathy or compassion for what they are doing. I do know that I feel our country has totally inadequate cruelty, abuse and neglect laws to help protect our animals. Even the states with the toughest laws could make tougher ones. \nNo animal cruelty law should be less than a major felony. No neglect law should be less than a minor felony, at the least. And people caught breeding and fighting animals should be locked up for life.\nMost Humans are really the devil in the form of humans!", u'id': u'968645286478846_969017843108257', u'user_likes': False}
