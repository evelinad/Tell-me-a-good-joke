That is why we have hunting season. I don't agree with strictly sport hunting; if you don't want to eat it find someone who does and give it to them. True hunting involves trying for a quick, clean kill with as little pain as possible. They don't want animals to suffer. Some areas have been criticized recently for offering to pay a nominal amount for bringing in dead feral hogs. It isn't out of cruelty; the feral hog population has gotten out of control and they are very dangerous animals. Some families use hunting as their primary source of meat out of preference or for financial reasons. I don't like this display of wolf carcasses but the hunting is necessary if the population is out of control.
