The problem I have is when they are, I am sure the punishment will not be severe enough.  If we have very hard and strict punishments for animal cruelty then the crime rate will go down.  Weak punishments only condon their bad behavior.  Poor thing, I hope they rot for what they have done, just let them rot.  Its not a joke, this was someones family who suffered with great pain. Im sure they took pleasure while they did it.  Look for someone local.', u'id': u'973447619331946_974029712607070', u'user_likes': False}
