Cats do have the same prey instincts on smaller animals. Are animals guilty for that? Not really. People are different. They can think ahead and prevent. But at times things are unpredictable. The owner was dragged. This is one of these unpredictable situation where no one could do anything. I am sorry for the cat but this appear to be an accident. Following this accident the owner should be mandated not to walk the two dogs if he cannot control them, and train them. Sadly, the article seems to blame the owner of the dogs for having rescued the dogs too.', u'id': u'970778432932198_970828699593838', u'user_likes': False}
