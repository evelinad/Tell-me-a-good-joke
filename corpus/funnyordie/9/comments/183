Again this is not true -as most if not all jurisdictions have anti-discrimination laws.\n\nHowever, what this and other similar state laws would do is not allow the government  to force participation in any activity that one objects to on religious grounds.\n\nI will further clarify - (this is from personal experience) If you come into my restaurant and you are gay - you are welcome.  The preparing of food and serving you is my honor.  However - if you ask me to cater a gay wedding I will decline.  If you scream discrimination - I will whisper the name of Jesus.\nIf you shut my business down ...or take me to court I will defend myself within the legal and moral parameters that guide my life.  And if you succeed at taking away my freedoms or my  life - all under the false pretense of equality, and tolerance then so be it ... for my life does not belong to me.", u'id': u'10153154424318851_10153155984008851', u'user_likes': False}
