Does it make them an asshole for refusing people based on sexual orientation or race or gender? Absolutely. But the power is in the hands of the consumer here. If you disagree with an organization's discriminatory practices then take your business elsewhere! They are making stupid business decisions by excluding a percentage of their consumer base, so let them reap the consequences. Besides, laws like these let people put their hate up front. At least we know who they are. \n(As for the video, It was OK.)", u'id': u'10153154424318851_10153158083558851', u'user_likes': False}
