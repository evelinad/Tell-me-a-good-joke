Yes, Jesus laid out rules and teachings. And if we wish to follow him, we obey those rules. But we do it out of free will, not at the barrel of a government gun. \n\nWhat most are not wishing to concede on this--or any--issue, is that the free market will work this out. If enough people do not agree with a business' policies, the business may need to change that policy to survive. But there is absolutely no need for a government to forcibly tell someone who they wish to serve or not serve.\n\nEven our Lord and Saviour gave us free will. It's how we chose to implement that free will that will determine how things play out. And neither those who wish to discriminate, nor those who wish to force others to server them no matter their beliefs, can take the higher moral ground.\n\nOh, and who cares about a celebrity making a video? They are not experts on subject matters and have zero relevance when it comes to trying to influence a debate for any side.", u'id': u'10153154424318851_10153158822058851', u'user_likes': False}
