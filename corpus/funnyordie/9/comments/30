The fact that the gun would hold a gun to private businesses' heads forcing them to provide services to anyone for any reason (be it sexuality, beef for Indians, pork or alcohol for Muslims and unkosher foods for Jewish people) eliminates the RELIGIOUS freedoms we're SUPPOSED to have in America and ALSO eliminates the beauty of Capitalism. If a business wishes not to serve anyone for any reason, let Capitalism sort it out. They'll lose the business and it'll go to someone else thus causing Capitalistic failure and not because people are whiny babies and deciding to sue because their feelings got hurt.", u'id': u'10153154424318851_10153158341498851', u'user_likes': False}
