You think it takes someone of questionable integrity to refuse service based on some intolerance and your solution is to FORCE this business to serve you?  Surely you jest!

I hired a new employee, my 5 year old niece and SHE decorated your cake!\n\nOR... "Why does this cake taste like it was baked last month?"\n\nOR... "We had to use the special, imported cream based frosting for this cake and had it flown in special...  Here is your $5000 tab."\n\nOR... "I know we promised it would be ready by 5 pm, but  we had oven problems and it will be ready at 11 pm instead.  What time is your reception?"\n\nOR... "How much salt did that cake recipe call for?"\n\n...\n\nThere are any number of ways to legally resist without resisting, and it would take either a moron, a VERY gullible person, a very BRAVE person, and/or a total <F>\'ing idiot to actually use that business that is run by someone you feel is of questionable morals that you just FORCED to cater your very special, once in a lifetime event.  \n\nJust go somewhere else, get some caring individual that actually WANTS to serve you, and get a far better quality, cheaper, and safer product!', u'id': u'10153154424318851_10153156780068851', u'user_likes': False}
