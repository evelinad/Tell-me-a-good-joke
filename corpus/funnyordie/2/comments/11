Nothing funny about that. I only wish the day had been given a different name, so maybe the atheist haters out there would stop trying to invalidate it by somehow being connected with pagan traditions. Anyway, the truth is that Christians are thankful for Jesus every day, not just at Easter.', u'id': u'10153161656378851_10153161883953851', u'user_likes': False}
