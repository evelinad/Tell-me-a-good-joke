message: I was in a job interview today when the
manager handed me his laptop and
said, "I want you to try and sell this to
me."

So I put it under my arm, walked out of
the building and went home.

Eventually he called my mobile and said, "Bring it
back here right now!"

I said, "Â£100 and it's yours."
