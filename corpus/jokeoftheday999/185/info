message: Four men were bragging about how smart their cats
were. They had been trained as per their professions.
The first man was an Engineer,
the second man was an Accountant,
the third man was a Chemist, and
the fourth man was a Government Employee.
To show off, the Engineer called his cat, "T-square, do
your stuff."

T-square pranced over to the desk, took out some paper
and pen and promptly drew a circle, a square, and a
triangle.
Everyone agreed that was pretty smart.
But the Accountant said his cat could do better. He
called his cat and said,
"Spreadsheet, do your stuff."

Spreadsheet went out to the kitchen and returned with
a dozen cookies. He divided them into 4 equal piles of 3
cookies.
Everyone agreed that was good.

But the Chemist said his cat could do better. He called
his cat and said, "Measure, do your stuff."
Measure got up, walked to the fridge, took out a quart
of milk, got a 10 ounce glass from the cupboard and
poured
exactly 8 ounces without spilling a drop into the glass.
Everyone agreed that was pretty good.

Then the three men turned to the Government
Employee and said, "What can your cat do?"
The Government Employee called his cat and said,
"CoffeeBreak, do your stuff."

CoffeeBreak jumped to his feet.......
ate the cookies........
drank the milk........
sh*t on the paper.......
screwed the other three cats........
claimed he injured his back while doing so.......
filed a grievance report for unsafe working
conditions.......
put in for Workers Compensation..................and
went home for the rest of the day on sick leave............

AND THAT, MY FRIEND IS WHY EVERYONE WANTS TO
WORK FOR THE GOVERNMENT!!
