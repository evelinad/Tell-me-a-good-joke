message: Yesterday when an ISIS member stopped the car of a christian couple, and asked them if they are Muslim or not?

The Christian man: I'm Muslim

ISIS member: If you are a Muslim then recite a verse of Quran
Christian man recited a verse from Bible 

ISIS member: Yeah! that was right, you are allowed to go.
"What a risk u took! why did u tell him that we are Muslims? if he knew you are telling lie he would kill both of us" asked the wife when they got further.

"Do not worry! if they knew Quran they would not kill innocents" Answered the Husband.

ISIS is not Islam, terrorism has no religion.
