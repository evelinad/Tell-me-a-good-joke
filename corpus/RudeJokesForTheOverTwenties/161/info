message: Bert, age 80, always wanted a pair of authentic cowboy boots, so, seeing
 some on sale, he bought them and wore them home.
 Walking proudly, he sauntered into the kitchen and said to his wife, "Notice
 anything different about me?"
 Margaret, age 75, looked him over. "Nope."
 Frustrated, Bert stormed off into the bathroom, undressed and walked back
 into the kitchen completely naked except for the boots.
 Again he asked Margaret, a little louder this time, "Notice anything
 different NOW?"
 Margaret looked up and said in her best deadpan, "Bert, what's different?
 It's hanging down today, it was hanging down yesterday, it'll be hanging
 down again tomorrow."
 Furious, Bert yelled, "AND DO YOU KNOW WHY IT'S HANGING DOWN, MARGARET?"
 "Nope. Not a clue", she replied.
 "IT'S HANGING DOWN, BECAUSE IT'S LOOKING AT MY NEW BOOTS!!!!"
 Without missing a beat Margaret replied, "Shoulda bought a hat, Bert!
 Shoulda bought a hat."
