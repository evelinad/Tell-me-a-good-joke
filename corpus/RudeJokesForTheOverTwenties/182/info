message: Mick and Paddy
 Stew died in a fire and his body was burned pretty badly.
 The morgue needed someone to identify the body, so they sent for his two best friends, Mick and Paddy.
 The three men had always done everything together.
 Mick arrived first, and when the mortician pulled back the sheet Mick said, 'Yup, his face is burned up pretty bad. You better roll him over.'
 The mortician rolled him over and Mick said, 'Nope, ain't Stew.'
 The mortician thought this was rather strange.
 So he brought Paddy in to confirm the identity of the body.
 Paddy looked at the body and said, 'Yup, he's pretty well burnt up. Roll him over.'
 The mortician rolled him over and Paddy said, 'No, it ain't Stew.'
 The mortician asked, 'How can you tell?'
 Paddy said, 'Well, Stew had two arseholes.'
 'What? He had two arseholes?' asked the mortician.
 'Yup, we never seen 'em, but everybody used to say:
 There's Stew with them two arseholes.'
