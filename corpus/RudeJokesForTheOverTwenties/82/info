message: Barack Obama and David Cameron are shown a time machine which can see 100 years into the future.

They both decide to test it by asking a question each.

Barack goes first. What will the USA be like in 100 years time?

The machine whirs and beeps and goes into action and gives him a printout, he reads it out "The country is in good hands under the new president, crime is non-existent, there is no conflict, the economy is healthy. There are no worries.

David thinks it's not bad this time machine, I'll have a bit of that so he asks: What will Great Britain be like in 100 years time?

The machine whirs and beeps and goes into action and he gets a printout. But he just stares at it. Come on David says Barack what does it say?

David replies, Buggered if I know! It's all in Arabic
