message: Three women are out clubbing and they spot a club that says, "Women Only."
 Since they are without their boyfriends and husbands, they decide to go in.
 The first floor has a sign on the door that reads, "All men here are short and plain."
 The women laugh and continue up to the second floor.
 The sign reads, "All men here are tall and plain."
 Still this isn't good enough, and the women proceed to the third floor.
 "All men here are short and handsome."
 The women still want more and go to the fourth floor, where the sign reads, "All men here are tall and handsome."
 This is perfect and the women are preparing to go in, when they realise that there is still one more floor.
 They go up one floor and read the sign. "There are no men here. This floor is built only to prove that there is no way to please a woman.
