message: Fifty Shades of Chocolate Mr Cadbury met Miss Rowntree on a Double Decker. It was just After Eight. They got off at Quality Street. He asked her name. 'Rolo. I'm the one with the hole' she said, with a Wispa. 'I'm Marathon, the one with the nuts' he replied. He touched her Cream Eggs, which was a Kinder Surprise for her.Then he slipped his hand into her Snickers, which made her Ripple. He fondled her Jelly Babies and she rubbed his Tic Tacs. Soon they were Heart Throbs. It was a Fab moment as she screamed in Turkish Delight. But, three days later, his Sherbet Dip Dab started to itch.Turns out Miss Rowntree had been with Bertie Bassett and he had been fuckin Allsorts....:(
