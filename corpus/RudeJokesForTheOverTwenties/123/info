message: When God sends you help, don't ask questions.

 She hurried to the pharmacy to get medication, got back to her car and found that she had locked her keys inside.

 The woman found an old rusty coat hanger left on the ground. 

 She looked at it and said, "I don't know how to use this."

 She bowed her head and asked God to send her some HELP. 

 Within 5 minutes a beat-up old motorcycle pulled up, driven by a bearded man who was wearing an old biker skull rag. 

 He got off of his cycle and asked if he could help.

 She said: "Yes, my daughter is sick. I've locked my keys in my car. I must get home. 

 Please, can you use this hanger to unlock my car?"

 He said, "Sure." He walked over to the car, and in less than a minute the car was open.

 She hugged the man and through tears said, "Thank You SO Much! You are a very nice man."

 The man replied, "Lady, I am NOT a nice man. I just got out of PRISON yesterday; I was in prison for car theft."

 The woman hugged the man again sobbing, "Oh, thank you, God! You even sent me a Professional!"
