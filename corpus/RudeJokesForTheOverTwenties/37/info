message: A man goes into a library and asks for a book on suicide.
 The librarian goes "fuck off, you won't bring it back."
 The man sues the council for the trauma caused to him by a council employee telling him to fuck off, arguing that he was thinking of committing suicide and this nearly pushed him over the edge. He wins £3 million in damages.
 The librarian is sacked, then sues the council for unfair dismissal because they failed to take into account his traumatised state of mind after breaking up with his boyfriend and the start of his baldness five years ago. He wins £2 million, is reinstated, then signs off sick for the next five years.
 The council has to close the library, because of a hole in its budget caused by the £5 million in damages and £10 million in expenses. Your Council Tax is raised by £150 per year to cover this. David Cameron makes a speech about wasteful councils, Gordon Brown promises a full public enquiry and the Daily Mail says its all the fault of working class slappers getting pregnant at 15.
