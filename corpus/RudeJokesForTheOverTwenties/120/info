message: Abdul and Paddy are begging outside a railway station. Abdul has a Mercedes, a large house and is loaded, Paddy has fuck all. Abdul's begging hat is overflowing with with numerous notes but Paddy has just a few coppers in his.
 "How do you do it?" asks Paddy.
 "Look at your sign," says Abdul.
 Paddy's sign reads: "Out of work, wife and six kids to support, please help."
 Paddy then looks at Abdul's sign, which says: "I only need another Â£20 to get back to Pakistan."
