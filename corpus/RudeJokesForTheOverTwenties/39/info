message: A skinny white guy goes into an elevator, looks up and sees this huge guy standing next to him. The big guy sees the little guy staring at him, looks down and says: "7 feet tall, 350 pounds, Turner Brown." The little guy faints and falls to the floor.

 The big guy kneels down and shaking him: "What's wrong with you?" In a weak voice th elitle guy says: "What exactly did you say to me?" The big dude says: "I saw your curious look and figured I'd just give you the answers to the questions everyone always asks me: I'm 7 feet tall, I weigh 350 lbs, and my name is Turner Brown." The small guy says: "Turner Brown?! Fuck me, I THOUGHT YOU SAID 'TURN AROUND'."
