message: a bf visits his gf and they go upstairs to her room.. the mum comes home later and hears "baby, baby,, oooh aahh baby" coming from her daughter's bedroom and rushes upstairs..
 she breaks in nd asks wtf is going on here?
 the embarrassed daughter replies," we were having sex" to which the mum sighs "wheeeew.that's Ok.. I thought you kids were listening to Justin bieber"
