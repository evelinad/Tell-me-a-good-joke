description: HOLLEY NEW YORK...HELL ON EARTH
An estimated 1,000 innocent, adorable squirrels, many of them pregnant mothers or mothers tending newborns who will be left to die, will be brutally sought out in the woods they call home and murdered tomorrow in what the Holley NY Fire Department has promoted for several years running as a fun-filled contest for prizes to see who can kill the biggest squirrel, or the heaviest group of squirrels, all in the name of raising money for the fire department. This despite the outcries and pleas of thousands of goodhearted people. Many of these squirrels have been fed and baited to make them heavier and gain their trust. But tomorrow when they come for their daily nuts, they'll be met with slaughter. Children 12 years and over have been invited by the Holley Fire Department to partake in the grisly massacre. Offers like the one extended by For The Love Of Alex to pay a sum equal to the net proceeds of their "fundraiser" in exchange for cancelling the event were disregarded and ignored. So it's not about the funds, is it? It's all about the kill.

For those of us who understand and appreciate that all life matters, that every living being is on the same journey, that the right to life is divine, our hearts will die a thousand times tomorrow. For the tiny peaceful beings who stand no chance against humans and their weapons, for the deception and trickery of baiting, for the suffering they will know, and for their unborn and newborns left to die. How horrible is mankind. The personification of evil.

Shame on all the media and government officials who were contacted to help in the fight to stop this and never even uttered the slightest response. Kudos to Jane Velez Mitchell for calling attention to this and trying to help stop it on her Facebook page, the only well-known person we are aware of to do so. Shame on Holley NY for your despicable actions and evil mindset, for indoctrinating children to your concept that life has no value whatsoever.

In choosing an image for this post there are many horrific pictures from prior years' Holley NY "Squirrel Slams" out there. One shows a young girl taunting protestors with a bloody pizza box overflowing with her squirrel victims, an adult (reportedly her father) beaming the well known hunter's glee sick smirk behind her as they walk. (https://pbs.twimg.com/media/BhHDj-0IEAA20iQ.jpg). Or the trucks parading through Holley with their victim squirrels dangling from their bumpers and windows like some kind of demented Rose Parade from hell. (http://theirturn.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/941x485xSquirrel_slam_Holley.jpg.pagespeed.ic.OX4smhBur8.jpg). 
But we don't want those horrific images to forever be a part of our page. So instead we show an image of life as it should be, humans as guardians of the earth, not its destroyers. Giving a helping hand, to a precious life in need. We pray that one day the mindset of evil is eradicated from our world like the hideous cancer it is. To the precious, unsuspecting squirrels of Holley NY, please hide tomorrow. Please let divine intervention warn you and guide you. My heart is shattered for your tragic fate. God's little gardeners, you don't deserve this horror.
