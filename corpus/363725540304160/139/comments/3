These animals have to suffer prolonged and painful deaths. One especially cruel hunting method is bowhunting. A member of the Maine Bowhunters Alliance estimates that 50% of animals who are shot with crossbows are wounded but not killed. A South Dakota Department of Game, Fish and Parks biologist estimates that more than 3 million wounded ducks go "unretrieved" every year. A British study of deer hunting found that 11% of deer who had been killed by hunters died only after being shot two or more times and that some wounded deer suffered for more than 15 minutes before dying! \nAre bowhunters cruel and sadistic monsters? \n~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yywpjaEBz4c \n~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sduc_FDdHG0 \nDo animal suffer from bowhunting? \nhttp://www.youtube.com/user/DeliberateCruelty#p/u/10/vgA1iD0dhvg \nDo bowhunters and sports hunters kills mothers with babies? \n~ http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GSbVCLeaygA', u'id': u'963930010283707_964172220259486', u'user_likes': False}
