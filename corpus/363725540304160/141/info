message: SHOCKING!!! Animal drags itself to a house and 'cries' for help after Russian thug shoots it with an arrow and paralyzes its back legs

Residents fear that a sadistic killer is on the loose after three brutal assaults on animals have taken place in a single town - and some worry that the perpetrator may target a human being next.

The latest horrific attack was reported by Tamara Yerofeeva, 65, who opened her front door to find a stray cat 'screeching' for help with an arrow through its body.

The tomcat, whose back legs had been paralysed in the attack, had used its two front legs to drag itself to her door and meow for help.

'I heard this awful screeching noise outside the front door and opened it to find out what it was,' she said.

'I saw the orange cat lying on the porch with an arrow sticking out of it and blood on the ground. 

'I called police quickly because I thought the madman might still be around and might take a shot at me, and they took it to a vet.'
Police officers in the town of Kaluga, western Russia, say they are focused on hunting down the person who shot the arrow, and are appealing for witnesses to get in touch.

The local community has rallied around the cat. After the attack was reported in local media, donations to pay for surgery flooded in.

Specialist surgeons were able to successfully remove the arrow, which had pierced both of the cat's lungs and his diaphragm, and it has recovered the use of all four legs. 

Yerofeeva said: 'Although he is a stray, everybody in the neighbourhood likes him, or so we thought. 

'He is very sweet and tender. I can`t imagine who could possibly do something like this. 

'And if he can shoot a cat, is there not a risk person might be next?'
Illya Melnikov, 45, who was one of those who donated money, said it was not the first time in recent weeks that an animal had been tortured and almost killed.

She said: 'Someone left an injured puppy tied to a tree in the woods, and we also found a cat in a cage which had been dumped. In both cases the injured animals were only found by chance.'

Police are asking witnesses to come forward.
