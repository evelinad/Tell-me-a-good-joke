description: Great Apes in Crisis: Thousands Poached and Stolen from the Wild Annually!

Nearly 3,000 chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos and orangutans are illegally killed or stolen from the wild each year, according to a new report (pdf) from the United Nations Environmental Programme’s (UNEP) Great Apes Survival Partnership (GASP). The report, released to coincide with this week’s meeting of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) in Bangkok, links the activity to organized crime and the same international trade routes used by gunrunners, drug smugglers and money launderers.
