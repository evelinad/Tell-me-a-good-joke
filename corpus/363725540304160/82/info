description: MISINFORMATION: How to Tell If Your Make-Up Is Tested on Animals

If you’re an animal lover, then chances are you believe in buying cruelty free cosmetics, but in today’s marketplace with so many labels and misinformation flying around, how do you know what is and isn’t tested on animals?

Whether you’re already pretty clued in or you’re just getting started, check out the following tips to ensure you’re not unwittingly funding the ugly side of the beauty industry.

Third Party Testing! IMPORTANT READ!

Third party testing is a loophole that many cosmetic companies are using to distance themselves from the controversy of animal testing while still being able to market themselves as a cruelty free brand. What third party testing really means is that the company itself may not test on animals, but their parent company, or an outside organization, does the dirty work for them.

Misleading Labels

Another way companies are getting away with leading consumers to believe that their products are a compassionate option is by adding the term “this finished produce was not tested on animals” to their labels. The reality of this labeling is that the individual ingredients could have all still been tested on animals, but the combination of ingredients that have been used to make the finished product was not.

Common Animal-Derived Ingredients

If you’re interested in both animal testing free and animal ingredients free, then you’ll want to be on the lookout for these common animal derivatives that may be hiding in your make-up bag. While this list is not comprehensive, it does outline the most common ingredients. If you spot one of these then be sure to do some follow up research on the brand and how the ingredient was sourced:

۩۞۩ Look for the bunny – If you see a product stamped with the Leaping Bunny logo, it means that no animal testing is used throughout ANY phase of the product development.

۩۞۩ Watch out for new ingredients – Products touting newly developed ingredients are often the ones still testing on animals so beware and make sure to investigate further.
