description: Is eating meat a personal preference? 

This particular excuse has several variations but goes something like: “Eating meat is my personal preference, and since I respect your desire not to eat animals, I would appreciate your respect my preference to dine on them”. The problem with this justification is that it assumes there is no victim, no “other”. It implies that the meat-eater’s desires, traditions, culture, taste buds, or appetite are superior to anything or anyone else and that because of this, he or she is absolved from the harm eating meat causes, particularly to the one being eaten.  

Whenever we hear people make such a declaration, we should remind them that the “persona preferences” are inappropriate and morally reprehensible, especially when they cause injury or harm to another. “Personal preferences” don’t give humans license to hurt or kill! Billions of animals unnecessarily die because of the personal choices!

Animals don't just give us their lives. They are abused and murdered- killed with premeditation.  They don't just give us milk either, they must give birth first, in order to lactate... We take their children, then we take their lives. Murdering voiceless innocents is not a "personal choice". There is nothing humane about it. It's very simple; if you love someone, you don't kill them, you don't eat them………
