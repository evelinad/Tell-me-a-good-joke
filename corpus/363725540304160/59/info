description: Does "Humanity" exist? The Blood-Soaked Fur Industry

I find it completely ignorant and insensitive to kill a beautiful, innocent animal in order to rid him or her of its coat, so that some heartless rich person can wear it and show it off as their own. Money might buy luxury, but it does NOT buy a heart or a brain. This is a total disappointment and I really hope that it comes to an end. Murdering an animal for fashion is completely intolerable!! There is absolutely NO EXCUSE!!

When undercover investigators made their way onto Chinese fur farms recently, they found that many animals are still alive and struggling desperately when workers flip them onto their backs or hang them up by their legs or tails to skin them. When workers on these farms begin to cut the skin and fur from an animal’s leg, the free limbs kick and writhe. Workers stomp on the necks and heads of animals who struggle too hard to allow a clean cut.

When the fur is finally peeled off over the animals’ heads, their naked, bloody bodies are thrown onto a pile of those who have gone before them. Some are still alive, breathing in ragged gasps and blinking slowly. Some of the animals’ hearts are still beating five to 10 minutes after they are skinned. One investigator recorded a skinned raccoon dog on the heap of carcasses who had enough strength to lift his bloodied head and stare into the camera.

China supplies more than half of the finished fur garments imported for sale in the United States!

The tragic reality of fur industry! No animal should ever suffer such a hideous and violent death, ever!  Cruel!  I hate what we have become ........
