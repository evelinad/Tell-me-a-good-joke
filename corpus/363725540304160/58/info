description: What will happen IF we stop factory farming? A great scandal of our age!!!
 
Well, billions of animals will benefit from the end of the confinement, overcrowding, excessive growth rates and overwork that characterize intensive farming. And millions of hungry or malnourished people could benefit too.

 That’s why Raw has joined ‘Enough Food for Everyone IF’ – a powerful and diverse group of 80 organizations working together to lead the fight against the global hunger crisis.

Hunger is one of the greatest scandals of our age. According to the IF campaign:
•1 in 8 people are living with the pain of hunger
•It kills more people than AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis combined
•Two million children die each year because of malnutrition
•Millions more children face lost potential, stunting and suffering


Does the world produce enough food to feed everyone?
 
The world produces enough food to feed everyone. World agriculture produces 17 percent more calories per person today than it did 30 years ago, despite a 70 percent population increase. This is enough to provide everyone in the world with at least 2,720 kilocalories (kcal) per person per day according to the most recent estimate that we could find.(FAO 2002, p.9).  The principal problem is that many people in the world do not have sufficient land to grow, or income to purchase, enough food.
