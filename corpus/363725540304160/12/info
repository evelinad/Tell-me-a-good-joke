description: What is "ag-gag" bill?

ag-gag   noun   \'ag-gag\ Any bill or law that punishes those who expose abusive conditions on factory farms; verb The act of silencing opposition to the abuse of farmed animals.

Pigs raised for their flesh are beaten and kicked. Cows on dairy farms are jabbed at or electrocuted if they're too sick to stand up. Chickens are confined to filthy cages so small that they can't even spread their wings. 

And if the meat and dairy industries get their way, this cruelty could continue unseen.

Lawmakers in many states have introduced bills that would make it illegal for undercover investigators—like Mercy for Animals or PETA's—to gather evidence of cruelty to animals on factory farms. If these bills become law, more animals will suffer. 

Legislatures are debating these "ag-gag" bills, and our opponents are determined to see that they pass so that their horrific abuse can remain hidden from the public. They're scared because investigations like ours are so effective at exposing their cruel and often illegal treatment of animals—and making perpetrators pay. 

Take for example what happened in Iowa. What we found over the course of three months on a pig factory farm was heartbreaking: pigs jabbed in the eyes, kicked in the face, and beaten with metal rods. But thanks to support from compassionate people like you, our work brought about Iowa's very first convictions for the abuse or neglect of factory-farmed pigs. 

And we're not just providing the evidence for successful prosecutions—we're changing the conversation about factory farming all around the world. Each time an investigation of ours breaks, more people choose to adopt a humane vegan lifestyle. The meat and dairy industries know that their only shot at winning is to silence us. But I know that you won't let them. 

With your support, we've already helped stop "ag-gag" bills from passing in more than five states this year. But legislation is still pending in numerous states and may be introduced in Canada—so we need your help to fight back against the powerful meat and dairy industries. I hope you'll step up and help today.
