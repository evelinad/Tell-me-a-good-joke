description: The Sad Truth Behind Animal Shelters

Big Dog Breeds Are Pretty Much Dead The Minute They Walk In

Big dog breeds, such as Rottweilers, Dobermans, Shepherds, Huskies, Great Danes, Pitbulls, and more, are pretty much a goner from the minute they are dropped off at a shelter. These breeds are low on the list of adoptees, especially if they show any signs of aggression. People looking to adopt a dog are too afraid of these breeds to take them home and give them a home. Without raising this kind of dog from a puppy, owners shy away from the risk they could be taking on.

DO NOT BUY PETS! If nobody bought and everyone adopted, nobody would breed pets, and eventually, no innocent pets would die.  ADOPTION IS THE ONLY OPTION!  Help us spread the message, share us!
