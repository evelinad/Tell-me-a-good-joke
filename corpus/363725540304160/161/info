message: Trancing Rabbits : relaxed hypnosis or a state of fear?

Putting rabbits into a hypnotic-like trance is known in some circles as “bunny bliss” but in fact the opposite is true. Trancing a rabbit is now believed to be putting the bunny into such a profound state of fear that is becomes paralyzed.

Tonic Immobility or TI is what the scientists refer trancing to. It is considered to be a fear motivated defense mechanism. TI is considered a last attempt for prey to escape being eaten by a predator. When a rabbit is in a TI state, it is playing dead. There are advantages to using this method when escape seems impossible. For example, if a fox has caught a rabbit, the rabbit might play dead. Thinking its prey is dead, the fox will stop attacking and may even let go of the rabbit or loosen its grip. In a split second, the rabbit might suddenly spring to life and escape.

The rabbit is frozen in fear. Rabbits hate water more than cats. This is NOT a relaxed and happy rabbit. This is a tranced rabbit:

In the simplest of terms, tonic immobility is "playing dead." While people might teach their dogs to play dead as a fun trick, for a rabbit it's an extreme means of surviving an attack. When a rabbit has been caught by a predator, tonic immobility allows him to become limp and unresponsive. His blood pressure and respiration rate drop as well. This often convinces the predator that the rabbit is dead and gives him one last chance to escape.

Dangers

Purposely inducing tonic immobility by laying a rabbit on his back can cause him serious stress. While he may appear relaxed during the trance-like state, afterward his heart and respiration rate is likely to be very high. A study led by Dr. Anne McBride of the University of Southampton found that rabbits show signs of extreme stress after an episode of tonic immobility. Another danger of placing a rabbit on his back is that he could break his back if he struggles against being turned over.
