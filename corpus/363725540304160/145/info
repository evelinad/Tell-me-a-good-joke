description: Shocking footage: EU pig investigations

Compassion in World Farming had visited 31 farms in 3 countries. In Spain, Italy, and Ireland, their investigators found farms blatantly flouting the EU Pigs Directive – a piece of legislation designed to protect the welfare of all the EU’s 140 million pigs.

CWF investigation has exposed:

*Pigs confined to narrow sow stalls, despite a ban* on the use of these cages. 

*Pigs living in completely barren environments, housed on bare concrete with nothing to satisfy their inquisitive minds 

*Pigs with tails routinely docked – a painful mutilation used to prevent tail-biting, which can occur when pigs are forced to live in barren conditions 

*Signs of tail biting as a result of poor conditions
 
*Pigs living in pens inches deep in excrement 

*Severe injuries caused by fighting, with some pigs so severely wounded they had died from their injuries 

*Signs of cannibalism as a result of barren conditions and extreme boredom
 
*Pigs left sick or injured, sometimes left to die, in corridors 

*‘Dead bins’ full of pigs that had clearly lived in horrific conditions. 

Please watch the video and sign the petition. We must tell the world what is happening behind the closed doors of EU pig farms!
