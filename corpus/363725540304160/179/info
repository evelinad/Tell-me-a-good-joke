description: Would anyone buy ivory if they had witnessed this cruel slaughter?Elephants and Rhinos under siege!

The largest land mammals in the world, elephants, naturally, have equally large home ranges. African forest elephant can range more than 772 square miles, and Asian elephants can occupy a territory of up to 40 square miles. Not surprisingly, both species are endangered. As the human footprint has grown larger, elephant habitats have shrunk. They have been converted into farmland or deforested as industrial logging and mining spreads, and as roads and settlements encroach deeper into the forest. 

The common hippopotamus follows elephants and the white rhino as Africa’s third largest land mammal. It lives in rivers, lakes, and muddy wallows throughout the continent. Hippo habitat has greatly diminished over the past 200 years, and hunting has further reduced hippo numbers, primarily due to poaching for meat and the ivory contained in the animals' massive teeth and tusks. 

In 1979 there were an estimated 1.3 million African elephants. A decade later, widespread poaching had reduced that figure by more than half. Just 600,000 African elephants remained.

Africa’s savannahs and forests were no longer sanctuaries for elephants; they had been turned into graveyards.

In 1989, a worldwide ban on ivory trade was approved by CITES. Levels of poaching fell dramatically, and black market prices of ivory slumped.

Since 1997, there have been sustained attempts by certain countries to weaken the ban. In 1999, Botswana, Namibia and Zimbabwe were allowed an ‘experimental one-off sale’ of over 49,000kg of ivory to Japan. Then in 2002, a further one off-sale was approved, which finally took place in 2008 – and resulted in 105,000kg of ivory being shipped to China and Japan.

Today, levels of poaching and illegal trade are spiralling out of control once again. In many areas, rates of poaching are now the worst they have been since 1989. In 2009, over 20,000kg of ivory was seized by police and customs authorities worldwide and in 2011, just thirteen of the largest seizures amounted to over 23,000kg, breaking all records since the ivory ban. 

In July 2012 CITES recognised that elephant  poaching had reached 'unsustainable' levels, not only in small unprotected populations but also among larger populations traditionally regarded as safe. Between October 2012 and January 2013 over a 12 week period, 12 tonnes were seized in just 4 incidents. 

The solutions

In a climate where both the black market price for ivory and its demand are so high, elephants' lives are put at risk by the mere prospect of a sanctioned sale of ivory. If the poaching of elephants and ever growing trade in illegal ivory is to be seriously addressed, part of the solution to this complex problem must be a return to the full ban on the sale of ivory established in 1989.   

Other measures which must be taken with urgency include:

•Address the involvement of international criminal syndicates by means of strong law enforcement at both national and international levels along the full extent of the supply - demand chain. The effectiveness of this measure should be judged not only by ivory seizures and arrests recorded but also by convictions with proportionate penalties and the disruption of the implicated trade networds.
•Close down domestic (national) markets in ivory, to accompany the trade ban instituted by CITES.
•Educate consumers in order to stem the demand for ivory. A survey in China found that almost 70% of the public thought ivory did not come from dead elephants but that it fell out naturally, like teeth.

The alternative to taking the bull by the horns? Some countries continue to report localized extinctions of small vulnerable elephant populations, a number of others edge closer to losing all their remaining elephants and the larger 'safer' populations start or continue their own downward spiral.
