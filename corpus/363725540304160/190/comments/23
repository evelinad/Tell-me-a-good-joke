Unfortunately many people, especially in this province, are inhumane beings who don't understand the commitment when they adopt to sterilize, and the vets charge way too much and soooo many make money off the backs of animals by running puppy and cat mills.  The laws are changing, but not fast enough.  Only we can make it go faster by demanding it!  Please contact your representatives - your votes do mean something.  Do it in the name of this beautiful creature who died alone, scared and cold.  Makes me sick to my stomach.", u'id': u'958821104127931_958852904124751', u'user_likes': False}
