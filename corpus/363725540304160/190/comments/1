For the person who said that this kitten doesn't looke frozen, you obviously have never done rescue.  A lot of dead animals don't appear to be deceased.  My kitten will be losing it's ears shortly due to frostbite.  The poor thing had to be given morphine because it was in such pain but still managed to purr.  Stop letting your animal procreate.  Spay and neuter.  I am just sickened by all of this suffering and sensless torture.  The summer weather isn't going to make things any differents.  The animals will just die from the heat.  Do what you can to advocate and educate.  Post reminders to people on FB.  Sign petitions for tougher laws against cruelty to animals.  Those who are cruel to animals are more than likely cruel to helpless children and adults.", u'id': u'958821104127931_958827290793979', u'user_likes': False}
