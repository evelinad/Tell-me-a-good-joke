And you have an unhealthy relationship with dogs. The fact that t thousands of dogs and cats are not cared for has nothing to do with breeders. As to pit bulls go.to any intercity shelter and see complete lack of responsibility by backyard alley.breeders. its is.the carelessness of pet owners that lead to over breeding. Any serious breeder would never let his prise bitch breed indiscriminately. Or to often. There is nothing finer than a well bred working dog. And a dog without purpose is cheated out of its birthright. What would have a world of mutts useless little.friends . does it empower you to have a little sycophant panting at your every whim. Animals have no rights. You cannot have rights if you can't concieve responsibility. Humans have responsibility to care for there animals . as soon as you can make all humans responseable your problem will be solved. Good luck with that.", u'id': u'960016584008383_960073910669317', u'user_likes': False}
