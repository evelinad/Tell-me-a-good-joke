Your a fanatic with a unhealthy relationship with animals . I'll bet you have problems with human relationships. I've have hunted for 40 years and never found a dog tied to a tree. I did find a mutt bitch left in the woods . scared and hungry. I tried to get a leash on her but she was so scared she tried to bite me. I had half my lunch in my truck and threw it to her. I called the dig of fish and game on my cell and they sent out animal rescue. I wiated so she wouldn't leave. Some asshole pet owner took out and dumped her. Lying about you'd fantasies doesn't help your case.", u'id': u'960016584008383_960087270667981', u'user_likes': False}
