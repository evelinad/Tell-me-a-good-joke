I love my little dog with all my heart both her mother and dad were AKC registered dogs that accidentally bred.  I love shih  tzu they are awesome little dogs. Some people prefer some breeds over others. My dog has been spayed. My next dog will be a shih tzu or shih tzu mix. Our shelters ask for 200+ to adopt them. My next shih tzu will be from a shih tzu rescue.', u'id': u'960016584008383_960184840658224', u'user_likes': False}
