description: Downed Animals

Every time I start trying to talk to people about how their food is made, they always say, "Just don't tell me about the slaughterhouses, I don't wanna hear it!"  And the thing is, I get it.  People want to imagine their burger grew up in a beautiful field with lots of grass to eat and lots of other cows to hang out with, but the truth is different, painful.....

When cattle is rounded up by the ranchers, they can get very scared and are often injured. When cows are injured to the point that they can no longer stand or walk, they are called "downed". Some downed animals are neglected and left to die while others are beaten and dragged on their way to slaughter.

The heartbreaking true story of a downed cow who was kicked in the face, ribs, and back in an effort to get her to stand up and then left lying in the blazing sun or hours:

No matter where you are in this journey; whether you have already cut back on eating meat or are just starting to consider what that might be like- get ready for some wonders! Taking animals out of your plate is a miracle for your health, body and spirit! Do not allow others' greed of profit to brainwash you. Don't sponsor the industry that promotes unnecessary suffering. Stop consuming dead, abused flesh of other beings. Make a commitment to your health and to your soul. Compassion starts with you. Right here, right now - that's all you have.
