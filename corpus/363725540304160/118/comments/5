Let me tell you that i'm really not happy at all with this new 'function button' for reporting animal abuses.. !! as a matter of fact Facebook will not make any difference or a distinction between the real abusers or the one who are sharing videos or pictures for awareness from various industries such as from the dog meat or fur trade in China or any other animal abuse in the food industry or cases of torture toward animals! FB will take sanctions against them too ! they will get their videos or photos removed + a blockage! unfortunately so many idiots are reacting because on their emotional feelings and did not think deeply enough that they will also hurting people like me and others who are sharing animal abuses facts in order to take action! it sounds like a kind of 'Ag Gag' bill !nevermind if it will really happen, then I'm gone with facebook! i am tired to see those countless brainless people creating petitions and event protest to Facebook for to remove what they don't want to see on FB (most of them are womens) without thinking deeply that they will also affect animal rights advocates!I'm not on FB to share 'cuty pics of animals' with hearts..! this is exactly the goal of those bunch of idiots who suggested to FB to create this option! there are too many brainless people who don't think deeply enough!poor animals from now on all the crimes evidence committed to animals will be hidden and will disappeared as nothing has never happened..!! this new FB option function is a real 'blessed bread' for the criminal perpetrators abusers! end & over! https://www.change.org/p/mark-zukerberg-mark-zuc\u2026/u/10057201", u'id': u'966591983350843_966964639980244', u'user_likes': False}
