description: Help Stop the Sale and Use of Glue Traps
 
What Are Glue Traps?

Glue traps are a rodent control option on the market intended to trap mice and rats.  When an animal steps on the trap it becomes stuck to the surface.  As the animal attempts to free itself, it becomes completely enmeshed in the adhesive, eventually dying of suffocation, starvation or dehydration.

Why Glue Traps are Inhumane

* Cruel: Trapped animals chew off limbs, starve, dehydrate, and suffocate while trying to escape from the glue.
* Non-target animals: These traps are indiscriminate; pet and wild birds alike are frequently killed by sticky traps, as are non-target mammals like chipmunks and baby opossums.
* Human Exposure to Disease: Hantavirus (HPS) is a fatal respiratory disease passed through rodent droppings and urine. Animals caught in glue traps defecate and urinate on the sticky surface putting humans at an increased risk of contracting HPS.

How to Control Rodents Humanely

The best method of rodent control is prevention.  Rodents tend to set up camp in our homes when food and space are made available to them.

Remove potential rodent homes like yard debris, trash, construction waste, etc.

Eliminate food sources. Keep bulk food, seed, and dry pet food in metal cans with secure lids.  Pick up fallen fruit. Take birdfeeders inside at night.

Exclude rodents from your home. Seal openings 1/2 inch or larger around the outside of your house with metal, concrete, or Stuf-fit Copper Mesh Wool, which can be found online or at hardware stores.

Include natural rodent predators in your solution. A family of five owls can consume up to 3000 rodents in breeding season. Placing a nest box to encourage a family of owls to make your property home can be a great alternative to commercial pest control methods. Please visit www.hungryowl.org/ for more information.

Use catch-and-release traps as a safe, sanitary, and humane solution. Catch-and-release traps will allow you to remove rodents from inside your home, but you must prevent their return by sealing entrance and exit holes and removing attractants.
