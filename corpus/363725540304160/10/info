description: We all have to know about this nasty reality instead of hiding it away and not bringing awareness of THIS HOLOCAUST! If we don't bring awareness then we all are guilty of accepting it as normal and doable. Let's stop the evil! Let's be a voice for the ones that are weak and cannot talk!! Please share this picture and message, everyone must know, everyone what universities, labs, and hospitals do to these animals in the name of science!

Here’s a comprehensive list of companies that do not test on animals. This list is compiled and is updated several times a year by PETA. Those marked with an asterisk (*) manufacture strictly vegan products—made without animal ingredients, such as milk and egg byproducts, slaughterhouse byproducts, lanolin from sheep, honey, or beeswax.
