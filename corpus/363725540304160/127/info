message: Star the kitten healing after found with burns over her body

Found at an Ocala business, Star was barely alive. Karin from The Kitty Kabin at Whispurring Woods Rescue & TNR received the call about Star on February 14. But nothing could prepare Karin for what she would find once she got there. The tiny kitten named Star was barely alive. Karin stated:

When I picked her up February 14, 2015, she couldn't hold her head up, stand and could barely cry.

According to Karin, it looked as though someone had thrown hot fluids on the eight-week-old kitten. Star suffered from scalding burns to her face, ears and down her front legs as well as on her belly and back legs. Her face from forehead to chin was hard as elephant skin. Her skin had no elasticity to it. Her eyes could not open more than a tiny slit.

Weighing only 14 ounces, Star was half the size a kitten her age should have been.

Karin Phillips Ahrman runs The Kitty Kabin at Whispurring Woods Rescue & TNR. The Kitty Kabin is not a 501c3, so the funds Karin needs to help the cats and kittens in her care she must raise on her own; she does not get grants or donations from large corporations. Instead Karin relies on donations from other animal lovers, and also raises funds through an ebay store that she opened.

Right now, there are more than 30 cats and kittens at The Kitty Kabin at Whispurring Woods Rescue & TNR. Karin helps save cats from kill shelters and from free Craigslist ads. She uses TNR on feral cats to keep the population under control, and to feed and vet both the Kabin cats and those at the feral colonies.

“It was very touch and go for the first 10 days,” reported Karin. But thanks to the kitten’s strong will to live, the dedication of Karin Phillips Ahrman and Whispurring Woods Rescue, and the animal lovers who stepped up to help the injured kitten, Star is now on the mend.

And while one person may be able to help needy cats, donations are also essential in order to provide food, vetting, litter, flea control, wormer, shots, spay, neuters and microchips to dozens of animals.

To help Karin with Star’s vet bills, as well as the other cats and kittens in her care, click here for Star’s GoFundMe account:

A copy of invoices for Star’s treatment can be found on the Facebook page noted above. Donations such as food, litter, rags and towels are always appreciated, as well as assistance by volunteers local to the Ocala, Florida area. With 'kitten season' on the way, anyone local who would like to help with bottle feeding and socializing rescued kittens is asked to email Karin at whispurringwoodsrescue@yahoo.com.
