We make sure he never ever gets outside. With no nails for protection, who knows what could happen if he needed to protect himself. I didn't know this procedure was so sickening until I did my research after my cat kept licking and biting his toes where his claws used to be. He leaves horrible sores on his feet and toes. I tried all types of stuff on his paws and nothing stops him from chewing where his claws used to be. This procedure is cruel. My rescue cat is all the proof I need! I'm with you for supporting this ban world wide.", u'id': u'968933833116658_968962323113809', u'user_likes': False}
