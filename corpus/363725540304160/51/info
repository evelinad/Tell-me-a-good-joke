message: EASTER CHICKS

Sure, he’s cute…isn’t he? I think he’s adorable, when they come in I just love looking at them and their super soft and downy fuzz. Their sweet little chirping is infectious, and many people feel the same........

Around the Easter holiday, hundreds of thousands more chicks than usual will be incubated and shipped to pet stores, farm supply stores,  and individuals around the world in preparation for Easter. These chicks serve a single use for many people, namely adorable “gifts".

Many people purchasing the chicks as “gifts,” will do so without thinking that what is now an adorable, cuddly ball of fluff will very quickly grow into a full grown animals with needs and with nuances. Or even worse, they will become nuisances. As a result, the animal will be given up, abandoned, or worse. 

Individuals purchasing the chicks in situations where they will be handled by children, adults, etc. throughout an entire 8 hour or more work day, do not put into account the fact that the children will typically not know how to handle these animals. Especially considering the fact that many of these children will be very young, and some will not have had any experience yet in the handling of animals. The chicks will be choked, squeezed, dropped, rough housed and abused to the point that they will die or become injured.
