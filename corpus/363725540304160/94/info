Is this the reality now? Are we giving up humanity? Did our morals and values deteriorating? These image will tear your heart over and over, in fact Iâ€™m furious, I want to point finger, I want to blame, I want to curse, I want to burst in anger. But will these actions solve anything?  A big NO! I would only cause more trouble and enemies but the problem still lingers on the edge.......
