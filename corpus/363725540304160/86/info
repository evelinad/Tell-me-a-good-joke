message: Last night, I reported one of the most horrific case of animal abuse. GUYS PLEASE REMEMBER: NEVER EVER protest to FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE or any other website to "shut down/remove" animal abuse sites, videos, pictures. NEVER SIGN PETITIONS OR ASK TO SHUT DOWN such pages...IF you do, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING the animals being fought, used as bait, tortured and abused.

WHY it makes YOU RESPONSIBLE?

Because NONE OF THE WEBSITES REPORT ANY ANIMAL CRUELTY SITES, PAGES, VIDEOS TO ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHATSOEVER!! All they do is "shut down" the pages or sites, leaving NO AVENUE for the people to be located and arrested and prosecuted....leaving NO AVENUE for the animals to be located and saved; you just closed the only hope of the animals ever being found, and you just caused more animals to go thru the same thing because the people involved WILL CONTINUE to do it....ANY ABUSE, from dog fighting to anything else of animals you see online, on any website, WORLD WIDE

PLEASE FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE WHERE AND HOW TO REPORT ANIMAL ABUSE:

THANK YOU!
description: HOW AND WHERE TO REPORT ANIMAL CRUELTY 

The Internet delivers an astounding array of images and ideas into homes across the world—but not all of these images are particularly animal-friendly. In the United States, individuals have the constitutional right to free speech, which includes the right to discuss and advocate for animal abuse in public forums like the Internet. 

Unfortunately, some of what is being shown online crosses into the realm of illegal activity. Rest assured, animal cruelty is a crime in every state—if people go beyond discussion and actually practice what they preach, they can be prosecuted for animal cruelty under their local laws.

What Is a Hoax?

While some online images of animal cruelty are, sadly, all too real, many websites that appear, at first glance, to promote animal cruelty are hoaxes. Of course, websites that are disturbing or disgusting are not breaking the law if no animals are actually being harmed. While you can certainly express your opposition to these sites to the companies that host them, be aware that their content is protected by the First Amendment. 

Remember, hoaxes and parodies on the Internet, no matter how offensive, are exempt from cruelty laws.

WHERE TO REPORT

Find out who is responsible for investigating and enforcing the anti-cruelty codes in your town, county and/or state. These people typically work for your local humane organization, animal control agency, taxpayer-funded animal shelter or police precinct.

If you run into trouble finding the correct agency to contact, you should call or visit your local police department and ask for their help in enforcing the law. If your local police department is unable to assist, ask your local shelter or animal control agency for advice.

REPORTING ONLINE ANIMAL CRUELTY

NEVER EVER protest to FACEBOOK, YOUTUBE or any other website to "shut down/remove" animal abuse sites, videos, pictures. NEVER SIGN PETITIONS OR ASK TO SHUT DOWN such pages...IF you do, YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR KILLING the animals being fought, used as bait, tortured and abused. 

WHY it makes YOU RESPONSIBLE? 
Because NONE OF THE WEBSITES REPORT ANY ANIMAL CRUELTY SITES, PAGES, VIDEOS TO ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES WHATSOEVER!! All they do is "shut down" the pages or sites, leaving NO AVENUE for the people to be located and arrested and prosecuted....leaving NO AVENUE for the animals to be located and saved; you just closed the only hope of the animals ever being found, and you just caused more animals to go thru the same thing because the people involved WILL CONTINUE to do it....ANY ABUSE, from dog fighting to anything else of animals you see online, on any website, WORLD WIDE.......

The main things you must NOT do:

1. DO NOT CONTACT THE WEBSITE OWNER. While it may be mildly therapeutic to tell them what you think of them and their actions, you will be alerting them to their discovery and they may remove the offensive information.

2. DO NOT FLAG THE WEBSITE FOR REMOVAL FROM A PUBLIC SITE such as Facebook, MySpace, Twitter, or others, as that may permanently delete evidence needed to build a case against the offender.

3. DO NOT SHARE the information with others, because they may act in either of the above ways which will defeat your purpose. Sharing the website may also increase traffic to the website in question which may support the offender or excite the offender.

4. DO NOT CREATE AN ONLINE PETITION for the same reasons as listed above.

Now you must collect your evidence

Collect as much information as possible. If you are lacking some of the information listed below, you should still share the information that you do have, and a link to the website with the appropriate reporting agency.

1. Download as much of the information from the website, IE photos, videos, etc. as you can and save them.

2. Print out copies of the offending pages.

3. Be sure to have as much personal information on the person running the website as possible including, but not limited to, the name, contact information, and location.

4. Try to determine if the offender is within the United States or elsewhere.

5. Try to determine the offender's ISP address. You can do this at

REPORTING ANIMAL CRUELTY WITHIN THE USA

You would follow these instructions to report a US based crime, even if you are not a resident of the US or are not located within the US at the time of the discovery.

The Humane Society of the United States (HSUS) says while the quickest way to get help in an animal cruelty, neglect or abuse case is to dial 911, they recommend being prepared by programming the phone number of your local animal control department, animal shelter or humane society into your cell phone. 

You can also email HSUS at:
donorcare@humanesociety.org
or call 202-452-1100 or 866-720-2676 to report animal cruelty.

To report an animal cruelty or abuse crime that takes place within the United States, report the incident to the FBI. You must include as much information as you can including links to the offending material, names, locations, etc. The submission page for crime tips for the FBI is

https://tips.fbi.gov/ 

You should also report a US based animal cruelty website to the Internet Crime Complaint Center, also known as IC3. To file a complaint, go to this page:

http://www.ic3.gov/default.aspx 

There is no category for animal abuse, so choose a category and explain the situation in the notes. As much information as possible should be included in the report including links to the offending website.

Other resources for reporting Internet animal abuse, especially if you believe an animal to be in danger at the current time IE live streaming video, and you know the location of the offending party, include reporting to the local police and the possible offender's local FBI branch which can be determined here:
