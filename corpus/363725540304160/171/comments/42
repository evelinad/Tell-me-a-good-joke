I can't say I enjoy what's posted,but if we all bury our heads in the sand, then they just get away with it. I believe a very good and well known quote is that 'all it takes for evil to survive is for good men (& women) to stand back and do nothing' or something extremely similar to that.  We can't ignore what is going on, every little bit helps, and those that are doing these things will pay one day. Maybe their own rationality will wise up and make them consider what they have done, that would be my wish, no worse consequence than living with knowing you have harmed other lives for no reason. \n\nSo NO do not stop, keep at it,ignore the haters, your doing a wonderful and important thing that I think most people if they thought about it, would appreciate the hell out of you for it ! \n\nLove & Light, Violet", u'id': u'960303287313046_960630090613699', u'user_likes': False}
