description: Dogs Chasing Wildlife 

Predatory behavior in dogs is normal. Most dogs will chase animals who move quickly. However, unless we use our dogs to control vermin, move livestock or aid us as hunting companions, predatory behavior is usually undesirable. If your dog chases wildlife, he’s putting himself in serious danger. He could chase an animal so far that he becomes disoriented or lost and can’t find his way back to you. He could be shot by a hunter or caught in a trap. Hunters often shoot dogs they see harassing wildlife, such as deer and antelope. Your dog could be wounded or killed by the animal he’s chasing. In fact, dogs who regularly come into contact with prey are likely to get injured. A run-in with a porcupine might seem relatively harmless, but if your dog gets “quilled,” he’ll need medical attention. Quills that aren’t removed can migrate through a dog’s body and cause internal damage.

In any dog vs. porcupine encounter, the dog is guaranteed to lose. The dog will never learn to believe this, despite the pain from having quills stuck in his body.

When your dog undergoes a porcupine attack, quills can become embedded in its flesh. This can be a serious problem. Sometimes the expertise of a veterinarian is essential for removing the quills, especially if there are many. Removing the porcupine quills from a dog is painful, but can be done in ways that will limit the discomfort. Use this list of do's and don'ts can save you from harming your dog further as you remove the quills from its body.

Hold your dog securely

Removing porcupine quills from your dog's body is extremely uncomfortable. You are going to need help. Someone needs to hold the dog as still as possible. A muzzle is advisable as well since the dog may bite out of pain. Even if your dog is typically docile, its demeanor can change greatly when it is in pain. Protect yourself and your dog by taking these precautionary measures.

Grasp the quill firmly at the base

When removing the quills, use tweezers and gently pull the quill out from the base. Pulling the quill from the top can cause it to break off, leaving fragments inside your dog's skin. This can pose serious risks such as infection. If you happen to break the quill and cannot remove the second half, consult a veterinarian.
