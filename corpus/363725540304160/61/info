description: The European Union and the way its animals are treated

Every year three million European animals are sent on long, stressful journeys to be fattened or slaughtered outside the EU. A vast number of these go to the Middle East where Compassion’s recent investigation, in partnership with Animals Australia, has uncovered immeasurable suffering.

When European farm animals are exported to non-EU countries every shred of protection they once received in their place of birth is rendered meaningless. After enduring long, exhausting journeys by land and sea they may face terrifying ordeals at slaughter. Animals are dragged by their limbs, bound up with ropes, pinned down by groups of men, beaten with metal rods, suspended upside down for extended periods of time, and eventually slaughtered in unacceptable ways that leave them conscious for many minutes after having their throats cut.

Please take a moment to watch the film and slideshow below to find out more about this deplorable trade:

Please take action today. Email the Commission for an end to this suffering:
