description: EASTER EGGS: FROM SHELL TO HELL

When I was growing up, I looked forward to Easter for a few reasons: extra days off from school, and that I could dye and paint Easter eggs with my family.

Dyeing and painting eggs was a tradition in my house in Poland, and I never thought twice about it—that is, until I found out the truth about where Easter eggs come from.

Chickens are among the most abused animals in our food industry. There are very few laws in place that protect them. Chickens exploited for their eggs are called "layers".

After being born, they are sorted. Male chicks are considered useless in the egg industry, since they come from selective egg-laying strains, which are not suitable for meat production. They are discarded by being gassed, ground up alive or thrown into plastic bags or dumpsters.

One research scientist observed chicks being ground up and said that "even after twenty seconds, there were only partly damaged animals with whole skulls". With their skulls still intact, they were fully conscious and left to die a slow and agonizing death. Other eyewitnesses have told similar stories of chicks being slowly dismembered by machinery blades.

Did you know that 280 million chickens are used each year for their eggs? Here’s what they go through:

*At just a few days old, a large portion of each female chick’s beak is cut off with a burning-hot blade and without painkillers. Many birds, unable to eat because of the pain, die from dehydration and weakened immune systems.

*They are then crammed together in wire cages where they don’t even have enough room to spread their wings. Because the birds are crammed so closely together, these normally clean animals are forced to urinate and defecate on one another.

*At just 2 years old, most hens are “spent” and shipped to slaughter, generally to be turned into chicken soup or cat or dog food because their flesh is too bruised and battered to be used for much else.

*Since they can’t produce eggs, more than 100 million male chicks are suffocated, decapitated, crushed, or ground up alive every year.

Most people agree that it is wrong to inflict pain or suffering on animals for no good reason. Most people agree that hens kept in battery cages are suffering. But what about free range? Barn laid? Organic? You would assume that under these systems the hens live happy lives out in open fields, lives free of suffering, and they only die naturally from old age. This image is reinforced by cartoons of hens roaming freely, and people talking lots about the problems of battery farms, but not about the problems with free range. Check the video:

Dyeing eggs doesn’t seem so fun anymore, does it?
 
And did I mention that, cruelty aside, eggs are nothing more than chicken periods?
