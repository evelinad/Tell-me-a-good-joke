No what he did can not be undone but so far he has saved 20, thru his life he may save hundreds. He sounds like he was probably an abused child and may have never known compassion himself until the stray dog rescued him. I pray that he continues to help strays and finds human companionship as well.', u'id': u'972438119432896_972750922734949', u'user_likes': False}
