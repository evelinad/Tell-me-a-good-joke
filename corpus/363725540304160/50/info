description: CONFESSIONS OF AN ANIMAL ABUSER

"Nothing I do or say can make it right. Sometimes I hate myself as up to this day it still haunts me. I know people will judge me as a bad person after reading this and I can’t blame you as there is no justification for what you are about to read. All I ask is to share this story with others in the hope of stopping animal cruelty.

I was an 11 year old boy with a dog named Brownie. Unfortunately he got cut at the top of his left eye which got infected by maggots. 

I tied him to a tree to the back of the yard as my mom complained about his fowl stench. He was not fed for the three days he was tied to the tree and half of his face was already eaten away by maggots.

I took a red brick and started repeatedly dropping it on his head. After the second brick he still looked at me wagging his tale as though he was trying to say sorry. (I am writing this and tears are literally pouring.) After the fifth blow to the head he just laid helplessly struggling to breathe. 

I dug a hole about three feet deep and shoveled him inside. I then covered the whole with dirt. With the first two shovels of dirt you could see the sand still going up and down as he was still breathing. I then fully covered the hole and returned inside.

About four years have passed since that incident. One evening in the month of March I was coming from school when I was knocked down by a vehicle. The vehicle never stopped as it sped off. I was lying on the road in so much pain. When I looked to my right I saw a brown dog approaching eerily resembling brownie. He came and sat by me and started licking my foot as if to tell me everything would be alright. Two guys came to my side and called the medics. The dog stood by my side until they came never leaving once. He smelled and looked a bit shabby so I assumed he was homeless. After spending a week in the hospital with a damaged leg I was finally able to go home. I kept thinking about the dog and tears started flowing from my eyes as I immediately remembered Brownie and what I had done and this dogs eerily resemblance to him. 

About a month has passed and still I could not get the dog out of my mind. I went to the site where the accident happened and searched around and saw him. I called out to him and he came and jumped on me. At that moment I could not control the tears for the love and compassion that this strange dog was showing towards me. The next day I asked the neighbors in the area about him and they said he’s just a stray in the area. I took him home got him checked out by a vet and kept him as my own. Up to this day it haunts me what I have done to Brownie.

It just shows that animals have the power to change lives. They are so compassionate, loving and caring. That dog thought me how to love, and what love is. Not even my parents showed me the kind of love and attention that this dog has showed towards me. 

Today I have dedicated my life to educating people about animal abuse and cruelty. I have adopted 20 strays up to date. Although it proves a challenge keeping up with the bills I do everything in my power to make them happy. I just wish I could do so much more. I know that there are others out there who have no compassion towards animals or simply uneducated about proper animal care and the definition of cruelty. I am going to make a difference. I will do whatever it takes to stop animal cruelty. I owe Brownie this much."
