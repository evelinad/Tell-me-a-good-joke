description: Australia: Greyhound racing industry hit with doping, cruelty, collusion allegations

Australia's greyhound industry is the third biggest in the world, and each year Australians wager about $3 billion on the sport.

In the past year more than 70 dogs have tested positive to banned substances, but insiders say many more cheats go undetected and use popular drugs including cocaine, amphetamines, caffeine and EPO, the performance-enhancing hormone favored by disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong.

The relentless quest to produce a winner has also led to massive over-breeding, which results in up to 17,000 dogs being killed each year, some by inhumane means.

Many trainers are also in open revolt at greyhound racing authorities, who they say favor the richest players and hand down inconsistent punishments.

Whistleblower and vet Ted Humphries, who sparked an inquiry into the industry, says cocaine is a popular choice among cheats.

"The most common way [for cocaine to] be administered is just before the animal starts to race. It would either be administered by a sneaky injection or by wiping the powder on the animal's mucus membrane or gums," he said.

Racing authorities across Australia have been tightening their drug testing regimes. On Monday, they claimed their biggest scalp.

One of the world's leading trainers, Graeme Bate, was disqualified for nine months by Victorian racing authorities, sending shockwaves through the industry.

The veteran trainer's dog, Gunda Bale, tested positive to an elevated testosterone level at a meeting at Geelong in March.

Bate had previously recorded four positive swabs but until this week had only ever received a fine.

He is appealing against the severity of the punishment and is expected to win a stay on the proceedings, allowing him to compete for $350,000 next month in the world's richest greyhound race, the Melbourne Cup.

The industry has been plagued by scandal and misconduct for decades. The corruption was exposed in an inquiry sparked by Dr Humphries, but he says little has changed in the intervening decade and the anti-doping regime remains inadequate.

The industry is also under pressure over animal welfare concerns.

Dogs that are injured on the track are often killed. Thousands more never even make it that far because they are not cut out for racing.

They become what the industry calls wastage. Many are euthanized; animal welfare advocates say others are shot dead or get a hammer to the head.

Industry insiders have told 7.30 unwanted puppies are sometimes drowned.

RSPCA scientific officer Dr Jade Norris says the relentless quest for a winner has created a massive breeding industry.

"We know thousands of greyhounds are born every year that are surplus to industry requirements," she said.

"In fact, about 40 per cent of greyhounds born every year in Australia will actually never go on to race.

"That's a very high wastage rate and it's an unacceptable wastage rate. The RPSCA believes urgent action must be taken to reduce this massive over-breeding problem that leads to high wastage rates and also high euthanasia rates."

Greyhound Racing NSW estimates 3,000 greyhounds are euthanized each year in that state alone, a figure the RSPCA takes as a minimum.

FLORIDA: GREYHOUND RACING

Florida is one of only seven states that still has operational tracks, but information from both the Miami Herald and Tampa Bay Times highlighting the weak rules regulating the sport, soft penalties for abuse and questionable individuals involved has the industry back in the spotlight. In comparison to other states running tracks, Florida has been abysmally slow at ending the cruelty and getting justice for the dogs involved.
