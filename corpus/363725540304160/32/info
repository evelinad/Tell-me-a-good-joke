description: ANIMAL CRUELTY

When it comes to learning about animal abuse, people often bury their head in the sand, saying "I don't want to know". Sadly, this inaction actually helps animal abusers continue their cruelty unhindered. Every second, there is an enormous number of animals suffering pain worse than you or I could ever imagine, throughout the world at the hands of humans. 

The amount of animal cruelty in the world is so great, that more people are always urgently needed to help end it. It does not matter whether you have any money to donate or not, or how sociable or shy you are, whether you like to stay at home or be out and about, etc, because there are many different ways you can help stop animal abuse. Many of these ways do not cost a thing and are hardly any effort. 

Because animals do not have language that is understood by humans, they cannot make complaints, or sue anyone (they would be taken far more notice of then!).Even though animals obviously feel fear and pain, just like humans, sentences for animal abuse do not reflect that. They are extremely lenient and not at all a deterrent or just. In many countries, horrific animal cruelty is perfectly legal, and some countries actually encourage it! 

If you would like to see what you can do to help stop this abuse, please go to the Help Stop Animal Abuse And Suffering page:
