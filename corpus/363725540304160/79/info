description: Donkeys in Nepal are true beasts of burden. They are made to work till they drop dead. Something MUST be done!!!

In addition to the child labor story that predominates these brick pits, is the untold story of donkeys and bricks, as these domestic animals are the backbone of brick production, working day and night hauling and heaving the heavy loads of materials that eventually become the foundation of the ever-expanding metropolis of Kathmandu. There are no laws that govern their treatment, and no labor party to represent their needs.

"When we first started working with donkeys in
Lalitpur brick kilns we did not know exactly
what to expect. “How much dressing should we
buy for 150 donkeys?” we asked Dr Sudip
Koirala, coordinator of the mobile clinics. “Buy
as much as you can; it’s hard to find a donkey
without wounds,” he said.

We found this hard to believe. The brick kiln
season had recently started and the donkeys had
only just arrived. But Dr Koirala was right.
The 150 donkeys we treated did not only suffer
multiple wounds, including deep tissue injuries,
they were malnourished, dehydrated, stressed,
depressed, and they seemed unable to survive
another five months of hard labour. At least five
donkeys had already died from their injuries. One
of them was so badly hurt during transportation 
from the Terai, her spine was broken. She was
simply left to die by the side of the road. A painful
slow death with no one paying any attention."  ~Animal Nepal

This video was inspired by the work of Lucia DeVries and others, who have started to organize health camps and other projects in order to help the Nepali Brick Kiln Donkey, as well as other workers in the pits - underage children. These folks are pioneering animal welfare where it dared not go before: into many of the over 500 brick kilns seen belching black smoke throughout the Kathmandu Nepal:
