message: Wisconsin-based Global Conservation Group announced that they are launching a public awareness campaign in an effort to halt proposed “ag-gag” laws in Wisconsin, Colorado and Washington. The group says these bills attempt to silence whistleblowers working on factory farms and would make it a criminal offense to document or report cruelty to animals:

The recording of undercover videos showing animal cruelty in farming practices is now illegal: what are Ag-Gag Laws and why are they dangerous

These bills are troubling not only to animal protection activists, but also to those concerned with food safety, labor issues, free speech, and freedom of the press. The bills would apply equally to journalists, activists and employees. By prohibiting any type of undercover recordings, a farm's own employees would be prohibited from attempting to record food safety violations, labor violations, sexual harassment incidents or other illegal activity. First Amendment concerns were raised because the MN bill would have prohibited the broadcast of undercover videos, and the FL bill originally prohibited any unauthorized photos or videos of a farm, including those shot from a public street.

Undercover photos and videos have been used extensively by the animal protection movement to expose farming cruelty, whether the activity is legal or illegal. These bills are a reaction to the bad publicity that erupts whenever a new undercover video is released.

"A few months ago, I stood outside a slaughterhouse in Draper, Utah, filming what most people would not dare look at for a moment. I saw cows that were being led into the building struggle to turn around once they smelled and heard the misery that awaited them. I saw piles of horns scattered around the property and flesh spew from a chute on the side of the windowless building. I also witnessed inexcusable animal abuse — a live cow that appeared to be sick or injured being carried away from the building by a tractor as though it were nothing more than rubble.

My hope was that, through my videotaping of what appeared to me to be acts of cruelty, perhaps charges could be filed. And indeed they were: against me." ~Amy Meyer

A wave of laws that target animal welfare activists who take undercover videos at factory farms has been criticized for chilling free speech and allowing cruelty to continue in secret. But it’s not only animal well-being at issue. So is public health.

Some food safety experts say these so-called ag-gag laws will cloak disease-spreading industry practices, such as processing ill cattle and housing poultry in filthy conditions, in secrecy, raising risks of food contamination.

“The ag-gag laws are touted as preventing animal activists from getting access to private places, but there’s a much broader concern the public should have,” said Elisabeth Holmes, a staff attorney at the nonprofit Center for Food Safety. “Public health issues, food safety issues, environmental issues: all those things can be exposed through undercover investigations.”

Photo: Meat production begins with the killing of "unprofitable" infants. PACing (or thumping) is a pig industry term that means Pounding Against Concrete. It is a method of killing piglets whereby the piglet is picked up by the hind legs and slammed to the floor, causing head trauma. The smallest piglets of each new litter are killed at one or two days old, because these "runts" are considered unlikely to reach "market weight" by the desired slaughter date. Millions of piglets are killed inhumanely each year in Canada and United States by PACing – Pounding Against Concrete.
