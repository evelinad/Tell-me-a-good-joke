description: Neglected, chained dog dies in the bitter cold every winter!

Nothing hurts quite as badly as a call for help that comes too late...

Thousands of people are mourning the senseless death of a beautiful dog they did not know...a neglected, tethered dog who was left outside in frigid conditions, without adequate shelter...a dog who perished as a result.

Rough Road Rescue, Inc., which is located in Perry County, Mo., shared the bitter news of the neglected boxer's passing via Facebook on Sunday:

Both of these dogs was tied out. no food no water and barely any protection. Well I have both the animals. It kills me to say, I was called a little late. This beautiful animal (boxer) couldn't stand the bitter cold with no food or water to sustain his body.

He laid down and died. By himself with no one to comfort him. Except for the other dog. A chocolate lab, which was unable to get close to the boxer and watched as her friend froze to death. She is safe and will be cared for here at the rescue.

The rescue added:

I will bury her friend out here. And give him the respect he deserved.

Extreme winter weather is blanketing much of the nation - unfortunately, many dogs are not provided with the comfort and safety of a warm home to shield them from the elements, and they are left to their own devices outdoors.

If you see a dog who has been left outdoors, without adequate protection from the elements, please reach out for help. If the dog's owner is unwilling to remedy the issue, contact local animal control officials as soon as possible.
