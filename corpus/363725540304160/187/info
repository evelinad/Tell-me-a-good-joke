description: Interview with Gary Yourofsky

“There is no such thing as "humane slaughter" like there is no such thing as humane rape, humane slavery and humane child molestation. How in the world could slaughter billions of innocents be done with love, humanity and concern? Cultures might excuse and ignore certain victims of cruelty but that doesn't exonerate the cruel act, especially from the victim's point of view which is the only thing that matters. “ ~Gary Yourofsky

Gary Yourofsky's entire inspirational speech held at Georgia Tech in summer of 2010. Listen to this amazing speaker who will blow away the myths, fill your mind with interesting facts, and help you make ethical choices for a healthy heart and soul. His charismatic and straightforward style is one of a kind - a must-see for anyone who cares about nonhuman animals or wishes to make the world a better place.

"At last we had the chance to meet Gary in person, a very controversial character in the world of animal advocacy that we did not know whether to recognize as a hero or not.
After spending some time with him and his wife in Bologna we realized how the media shape public opinion according to their need. When you talk to him in private it takes only a few minutes to feel that his nature is good, spontaneous and deeply altruistic and that he would never hurt anyone.
We decided to edit this video in 4 different clips, this one which is the full version of the interview and 3 others that are the same interview but divided into 3 parts."  ~ Veggie Channel
