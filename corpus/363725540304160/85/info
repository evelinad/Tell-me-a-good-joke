description: Together we need to take action to stop animal abuse!

The headlines are as brutal as they are catchy. A horse shot through the eye and killed – An innocent dog dragged to death behind a vehicle – Animals starved, drowned, burned, gored and other horrendous abuses. These are raw brutalities, at the same time fiendishly evil and gut wrenching. These acts are striking down our defenseless animals.

These outrages should make us mad as hell. History has proven that animal abusers are a mere short step away from torturing and tormenting people, too. We need to find solutions!

Education of our youngsters and everyone is really important. If we can put concentrated effort into reaching probable animal abusers and impress them at an earlier age, we might make some headway. We must halt viciousness and serious abuse. Our attempts to eliminate wanton animal neglect should be stepped up. Increasing our efforts to get the word out and citing specific examples of abuse and neglect has become urgent in these times.

Then we also need to encourage our legislature to pass punishments for animal abusers that take “a bite” – not probation, not a slap on the wrist, not admonishment – we need punishment that really punishes! The abusers repeat over and over again and that also must stop. If we require additional animal control authorities, then we must come up with the funding to do so. Judges require encouragement to come down hard on violent abusers and make it count.

There is much reason to take steps against animal cruelty, abuse and neglect – each abuser that is stopped may well protect not just an animal but also a human.
