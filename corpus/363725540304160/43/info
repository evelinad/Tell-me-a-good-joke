message: Heartless woman kicks dog's kennel cage in anger as she dumps dog at shelter

A woman surrendered her terrified dog to the City of Tulsa Animal Welfare on Friday; she had no regrets. Instead the woman demonstrated impatience and anger; much to the utter disgust of shelter staff and volunteer,"Mama Sherry," from Destiny the Pibble.

The dog's owner threw the dog down, tried to slam the door of the kennel cage and before turning her back, kicked the door in an attempt to kick the dog. Visitors and animal advocates stood there in shock.

Destiny the Pibble's Facebook page posted the following message late Friday afternoon, addressing her angry words to the former owner:

"You are a heartless and uncaring person. No matter what this innocent dog may have done, she didn't deserve to be treated in such an awful manner. When I took her from you, the poor girl was so terrified, she peed all over... karma will find you."

When a compassionate shelter employee scooped the terrified dog up into her arms, the dog began to relax. "Mama Sherry" continued:

"But you know what? It only took a few minutes of caring arms holding her and sweet nothings being whispered in her ear before she relaxed and sighed – finally, a kind person held her. And now, the kind and caring people at Tulsa Animal Welfare will do what you were obviously unable to do – find her a loving and caring home where she is cherished."

And the good news. Less than eight-hours later, the pooch has been made comfortable by the gracious staff at Tulsa Animal Welfare. An update on Destiny the Pibble's Facebook announced the happy news:

Christa **** "I named her Chunk. Since the lady tried to just chunk her and go. She's cute and has warm blankets with plenty of food and water."

Chunk now needs a home. She is described as a sweet, young dog. If interested, please notify Tulsa Animal Welfare in Tulsa, OK at 3031 N. Erie, 918-596-8011. Sharing saves lives, and Chunk deserves a second chance with someone who loves her.
