description: Working in Unity to put an end to these horrors! 

There is nothing more disturbing and heartbreaking along with many other emotions and feelings when it comes to cases of animal abuse and cruelty! Emotions and feelings that make us open our eyes and see the true reality of the world, and see some humanity for what it is - ugly, cruel, hateful etc - the true faces of EVIL!

But even though the faces of EVIL have been shown, and the reality of the world revealed it seems that many are going unnoticed - allowed to lurk within the shadows  "INVISIBLE" - until it is too late to prevent and undo the damages that it has already done to innocent lives forever -- 

The CAUSE of this invisibility is that many of the World, Government and Media are not only burying their heads in the sand to some of these issues, but they are turning away and ignoring to take steps in creating stiffer laws and punishments for those "MONSTERS" that are committing these horrific crimes against innocent lives... 

It is truly disappointing and really heartbreaking that laws and punishment are not strong and stiff enough to show the world that these actions against animals are not tolerated and that they are a crime against nature. Shouldn't the JUSTICE SYSTEM be there to STOP these crimes from happening - to enforce stronger and more punishable laws to make those accountable for their actions?  

It is very important that the WORLD, GOVERNMENT and MEDIA rethink and review strategies that they have taken to prevent such horrific crimes and make a change --- to spread the word and put the fear that "if you abuse, kill or be cruel to any animal whether on land, sea or air - you will be punished accordingly for crimes against nature!" --- and when i state accordingly, I don't mean mere slaps on the wrist (such as a small fine, or community service - or short jail term) --- These are innocent lives that are SUFFERING and being TORTURED and KILLED, not smashing a WINDOW -- So why is it that ANIMAL ABUSERS/KILLERS are getting sentences that are NOT FITTING THEIR CRIMES!

Is it possible to tighten up the laws regarding sentencing and punishment for people who commit these terrible acts against our furry (and feathery) friends? Help us! Join us! Share us!
